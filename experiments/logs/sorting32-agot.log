===============================

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is unsorted and needs to be broken down into smaller sublists to manage the sorting process more effectively.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[0, 0, 5, 9, 0, 7, 9, 9, 1, 2, 6, 1, 1, 9, 0, 1, 3, 5, 2, 3, 5, 6, 0, 2, 7, 4, 6, 2, 9, 7, 5, 9]'}
1: {'thought': [0, 0, 5, 9, 0, 7, 9, 9, 1, 2, 6, 1, 1, 9, 0, 1], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [3, 5, 2, 3, 5, 6, 0, 2, 7, 4, 6, 2, 9, 7, 5, 9], 'score': None}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is unsorted and has been split into two sublists in nodes 1 and 2. To further analyze the correctness of sorting, we should sort each of these sublists individually.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[0, 0, 5, 9, 0, 7, 9, 9, 1, 2, 6, 1, 1, 9, 0, 1, 3, 5, 2, 3, 5, 6, 0, 2, 7, 4, 6, 2, 9, 7, 5, 9]'}

4: {'thought': '[0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [3, 5, 2, 3, 5, 6, 0, 2, 7, 4, 6, 2, 9, 7, 5, 9]}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2, respectively. To progress towards sorting the entire list, these sublists should be merged.

Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Node 0 contains the full unsorted list, which has already been split into two sublists in nodes 1 and 2. To move forward, let's sort each of these sublists independently.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[5, 6, 2, 3, 1, 4, 9, 0, 5, 7, 0, 7, 1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 3, 6, 4, 4, 2, 3, 7, 1, 7, 0, 2, 5]'}

Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists that were originally part of node 0 and come from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. To proceed towards solving the whole list in node 0, we need to merge these sorted sublists.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[5, 6, 2, 3, 1, 4, 9, 0, 5, 7, 0, 7, 1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 3, 6, 4, 4, 2, 3, 7, 1, 7, 0, 2, 5]'}

5: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9]', 'score': None}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 5): {}
(4, 5): {}


Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 contains a sorted list that is a combination of the sorted sublists from nodes 3 and 4. To verify if this sorted list matches the expected correct order, we must compare it with the ground truth.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The current list in node 0 is unsorted and no other nodes are present. To begin solving this, we should first split the list into smaller sublists to simplify the sorting process.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[9, 6, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4, 7, 9, 3, 6, 5, 0, 8, 1, 8, 6, 1, 5, 3, 3, 5, 3, 4, 2, 2, 4, 5, 8, 6, 0, 3]'}

(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to attempt to form a single sorted list from the original list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[9, 6, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4, 7, 9, 3, 6, 5, 0, 8, 1, 8, 6, 1, 5, 3, 3, 5, 3, 4, 2, 2, 4, 5, 8, 6, 0, 3]'}

Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 is a result of merging the sorted sublists from nodes 3 and 4, and it appears to be a completely sorted list of the original array. To verify if this sorted list matches the ground truth, we will use the 'groundtruth' operation.

Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 are sublists derived from the main list in node 0. To move forward, we need to sort each of these sublists to handle smaller parts of the problem individually.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 represent sorted halves of the original list in node 0. To proceed towards solving the problem, these sorted sublists should be merged into a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[5, 3, 9, 6, 3, 2, 9, 8, 2, 4, 2, 1, 8, 1, 8, 0, 0, 3, 7, 4, 4, 9, 9, 5, 4, 6, 5, 4, 3, 4, 1, 1]'}

Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 appears to be a result of aggregating nodes 3 and 4 and might already be in sorted order. We should confirm this by comparing it to the ground truth.

Step 6
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists of the original list in node 0, containing the first and second halves respectively. To proceed towards the solution, we will merge these two sorted sublists into a single sorted list.

Step 8
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to potentially form the complete sorted list.

Step 9
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['6', ' 7', ' 8', ' 9']
Explanation: Nodes 3 through 9 seem to be various attempts at sorting two sublists that originated from node 0 and were split further. However, it is unclear if any of these nodes are fully correct, as none have been scored or compared to the ground truth yet. Node 5 is marked as not matching the ground truth, so we will score the remaining nodes to find out which, if any, are correct before proceeding.

Explanation: Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 all hold the same sorted list and have the same score. To streamline the graph, I will keep the best one (with the highest score, though they are the same) and remove the others.

Step 13
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['11', ' 12']
Explanation: Nodes 10, 11, and 12 are all derived from the same sorted node (5), but with different refinements and scores. Node 10 has a score of 1, meaning it is closer to the correct solution compared to the un-scored nodes 11 and 12. To determine which among these refinements is the best, we need to score nodes 11 and 12 to see how many mistakes they contain.

Step 15
========================
Action: refine
Nodes: ['13']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are already sorted sublists of nodes 1 and 2 respectively, and node 5 is an aggregation of nodes 3 and 4 but does not match the ground truth. Node 13 is another aggregation from node 3 and has almost perfect scoring with a minor mistake. To potentially correct this, I will refine node 13 to address the mistake made during previous operations.

Step 19
========================
Action: refine
Nodes: ['13']
Explanation: Node 13 has a low score of 1, indicating it has only one mistake in the sorted list, and node 14 has a score of 3, indicating three mistakes. To improve the sorting, we will refine node 13 since it has fewer mistakes and could potentially be closer to the correct solution.

Step 20
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['13', ' 17']
Explanation: Nodes 13 and 17 have been sorted and have scores indicating their accuracy. To proceed, we will keep the node with the highest score among these, which will be node 13 since it has a lower score indicating fewer mistakes.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: Node 0 contains the unsorted list. To proceed with sorting, we need to split this list into smaller sublists to handle them more effectively.

Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Node 0 contains the full list that needs to be sorted. It has been split into two sublists contained in nodes 1 and 2. Next, I will sort each sublist separately.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[9, 6, 4, 1, 9, 6, 3, 1, 1, 7, 3, 9, 2, 6, 2, 9, 9, 4, 2, 7, 4, 0, 2, 3, 1, 7, 9, 8, 3, 0, 7, 3]'}

(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists that were derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. We will now merge these sorted sublists to form a larger sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[9, 6, 4, 1, 9, 6, 3, 1, 1, 7, 3, 9, 2, 6, 2, 9, 9, 4, 2, 7, 4, 0, 2, 3, 1, 7, 9, 8, 3, 0, 7, 3]'}

Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 appears to be the aggregation of nodes 3 and 4, and it contains all elements from the original list in node 0, sorted. Therefore, I will perform a ground truth check on node 5 to verify if it matches the correct sorted list.

Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 are split sublists from the main list in node 0. Before any further operations like aggregation or refinement, we need to sort each sublist individually.


Graph state:
------------------------

Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to form a larger sorted list.

Step 5
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists derived from the initial split of the list in node 0. Aggregating these nodes should result in a correctly combined sorted list.

Step 6
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are already sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively, which in turn come from the original unsorted list in node 0. The next logical step is to merge these sorted sublists to form a larger sorted list.

Step 7
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['6', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 6 and 8 both seem to represent sorted sublists that are candidates for aggregation to form a complete sorted list. However, they have small differences in their content. To choose the best between them, we will first score both nodes to identify which has fewer sorting mistakes.

Step 12
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['9', ' 10', ' 12']
Explanation: Nodes 9, 10, and 12 have already been scored and all have a score of 2. We need to determine which one has the best score to keep or if they are equal, choose one. The keepbest operation will allow us to retain the node with the best (lowest) score among them.

Step 11
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['11', ' 12', ' 13', ' 14', ' 15']
Explanation: Nodes 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 all contain identical sorted sublists. To simplify the graph and keep only the necessary nodes, we will use the 'keepbest' operation to retain the node with the highest or adequate score and remove the others.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: To begin solving the problem, we need to decompose the list into smaller parts. We will split the list in node 0 into two sublists.

Step 1
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: To proceed, let's first split the initial list into smaller parts that might be easier to sort. The current node 0 has not been split properly. Therefore, I will split node 1 and node 2 further to refine the sorting process.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[5, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 2, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 5, 1, 4, 5, 0, 4, 0, 3, 6, 6, 8, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 7, 2]'}
1: {'thought': [5, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 2, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 5, 1], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [4, 5, 0, 4, 0, 3, 6, 6, 8, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 7, 2], 'score': None}
3: {'thought': [5, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 2], 'score': None}
4: {'thought': [6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 5, 1], 'score': None}
5: {'thought': [4, 5, 0, 4, 0, 3, 6, 6], 'score': None}
6: {'thought': [8, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 7, 2], 'score': None}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(1, 4): {}
(2, 5): {}
(2, 6): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 represent two halves of the list in node 1 and need to be sorted individually before they can be merged back together.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[5, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 2, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 5, 1, 4, 5, 0, 4, 0, 3, 6, 6, 8, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 7, 2]'}

Step 3
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 8 are sorted sublists derived from nodes 3 and 4 respectively. We should aggregate these sorted sublists to form a larger sorted sublist.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[5, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 2, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 5, 1, 4, 5, 0, 4, 0, 3, 6, 6, 8, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 7, 2]'}

Step 4
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 8 contain sorted sublists. We should score these sublists to understand how many mistakes each contains, if any.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[5, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 2, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 5, 1, 4, 5, 0, 4, 0, 3, 6, 6, 8, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 7, 2]'}

Step 5
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['5', ' 6']
Explanation: Nodes 5 and 6 are sublists that need to be sorted to progress towards solving the problem.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

Step 6
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 8 contain sorted sublists and are derived from nodes 3 and 4 respectively. We will aggregate these two nodes to form a larger sorted sublist.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[5, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 2, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 5, 1, 4, 5, 0, 4, 0, 3, 6, 6, 8, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 7, 2]'}

Step 7
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 8 are correctly sorted sublists and also reflect the correct partitions of their respective parent nodes. Therefore, we will aggregate these two nodes to form a larger sorted sublist.

Step 8
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['9']
Explanation: Nodes 9, 12, and 13 all contain the same thought, which is a sorted list from the original node 7. It would be beneficial to compare these nodes to check if any of them match the ground truth.

Step 12
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 8 are sorted sublists of nodes 3 and 4 respectively, which in turn are sublists of node 1. Similarly, nodes 10 and 11 are sorted sublists of nodes 5 and 6 respectively, which in turn are sublists of node 2. Given that nodes 7, 8, 10, and 11 have been sorted, we can now aggregate these sorted sublists to move towards a complete sorted list. First, let's aggregate nodes 7 and 8, the results from node 1.

Step 15
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 8 are correctly sorted sublists as indicated by a score of 0, and they are sublists that originally came from node 1. To continue the sorting process in the correct direction, I will aggregate these sublists to form a larger sorted sublist.

Step 19
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 8 have been individually sorted and scored with no mistakes. They represent the sorted versions of sublists from node 1. Now, we should aggregate them to form a larger sorted section of the list.

Step 20
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 8 have been successfully sorted and have a score of 0, indicating they are sorted correctly. They seem to represent smaller, correctly sorted segments of the original list. I will now aggregate these two nodes to combine them into a larger sorted segment.

Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 8 are correctly sorted sublists, each with a score of 0 indicating no mistakes. They represent sorted halves of their respective parent nodes. To progress towards sorting the entire list, we will aggregate these two nodes to combine their sorted lists into a larger sorted list.

Step 32
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['24', ' 9']
Explanation: Nodes 24 and 9 seem to hold the sorted sublists of the two halves of the list from node 2. Therefore, I will aggregate these two nodes to combine the sorted sublists into one and check if it matches the entire sorted sequence of the original list.

Step 34
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 8 contain sorted sublists split from node 3 and 4 respectively. They also have a score of 0, meaning they have no mistakes. These sublists can be aggregated to form a larger sorted sublist.

Step 35
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 8 contain sorted sublists that were derived from nodes 3 and 4, respectively, and are verified to be correctly sorted with a score of 0. Therefore, we can aggregate these two nodes to form a larger sorted list.

Step 37
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 8 are correctly sorted sublists with scores of 0, and each represents a different half of the original list provided by node 0. We will aggregate them to form a larger sorted list.

Result: success
===============================
Solving problem 11/100
===============================

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is unsorted and needs to be decomposed into smaller sublists for easier sorting.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 1, 7, 1, 8, 8, 7, 5, 7, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 4, 4, 0, 0, 3, 3, 5, 6, 9, 3, 4, 9, 9, 2, 3, 0, 5, 5]'}
1: {'thought': [4, 1, 7, 1, 8, 8, 7, 5, 7, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 4, 4], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [0, 0, 3, 3, 5, 6, 9, 3, 4, 9, 9, 2, 3, 0, 5, 5], 'score': None}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 have been split from the original list in node 0 but have not been sorted yet. The next logical step is to sort these sublists to start forming the ordered list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 1, 7, 1, 8, 8, 7, 5, 7, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 4, 4, 0, 0, 3, 3, 5, 6, 9, 3, 4, 9, 9, 2, 3, 0, 5, 5]'}
1: {'thought': [4, 1, 7, 1, 8, 8, 7, 5, 7, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 4, 4], 'score': None}

Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. To progress towards sorting the entire list, we should merge these sorted sublists.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 1, 7, 1, 8, 8, 7, 5, 7, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 4, 4, 0, 0, 3, 3, 5, 6, 9, 3, 4, 9, 9, 2, 3, 0, 5, 5]'}
1: {'thought': [4, 1, 7, 1, 8, 8, 7, 5, 7, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 4, 4], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [0, 0, 3, 3, 5, 6, 9, 3, 4, 9, 9, 2, 3, 0, 5, 5], 'score': None}
3: {'thought': '[1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8]', 'score': None, 'original': [4, 1, 7, 1, 8, 8, 7, 5, 7, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 4, 4]}

5: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 5): {}
(4, 5): {}


Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 appears to contain a fully sorted version of the original list. To confirm if it is correctly sorted in ascending order, the groundtruth operation should be performed on this node.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 1, 7, 1, 8, 8, 7, 5, 7, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 4, 4, 0, 0, 3, 3, 5, 6, 9, 3, 4, 9, 9, 2, 3, 0, 5, 5]'}

Step 4
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to form a larger sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 1, 7, 1, 8, 8, 7, 5, 7, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 4, 4, 0, 0, 3, 3, 5, 6, 9, 3, 4, 9, 9, 2, 3, 0, 5, 5]'}

(4, 6): {}


Step 5
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Nodes 5 and 6 are both sorted versions of the original list and need to be checked to see if they match the ground truth.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 1, 7, 1, 8, 8, 7, 5, 7, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 4, 4, 0, 0, 3, 3, 5, 6, 9, 3, 4, 9, 9, 2, 3, 0, 5, 5]'}

Step 6
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['6']
Explanation: Node 6 seems to be an aggregation of nodes 3 and 4 and could potentially have a correct sorted list. We should verify if node 6 matches the ground truth.

Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 1, 7, 1, 8, 8, 7, 5, 7, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 4, 4, 0, 0, 3, 3, 5, 6, 9, 3, 4, 9, 9, 2, 3, 0, 5, 5]'}

Step 7
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. To continue the process, we will merge these two sorted sublists into a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 1, 7, 1, 8, 8, 7, 5, 7, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 4, 4, 0, 0, 3, 3, 5, 6, 9, 3, 4, 9, 9, 2, 3, 0, 5, 5]'}

Step 8
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted sublists derived from the original list in node 0. To continue progress towards the final sorted list, we need to merge these two sorted sublists.


Graph state:

Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 1, 7, 1, 8, 8, 7, 5, 7, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 4, 4, 0, 0, 3, 3, 5, 6, 9, 3, 4, 9, 9, 2, 3, 0, 5, 5]'}

Step 9
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 represent sorted sublists derived from the original list in node 0. These nodes have already been aggregated into nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8, but these aggregates do not match the ground truth. Let's compare the sorted sublists from nodes 3 and 4 with the ground truth to verify their correctness.

Step 10
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively, and they need to be merged to form a single sorted list that represents the entire list. Therefore, we will aggregate them.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 1, 7, 1, 8, 8, 7, 5, 7, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 4, 4, 0, 0, 3, 3, 5, 6, 9, 3, 4, 9, 9, 2, 3, 0, 5, 5]'}

Step 11
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 all contain the same thought, which represents a sorted list. Before proceeding with further operations, it's important to verify if any of these sorted lists match the ground truth.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

Step 12
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['5', ' 6', ' 7', ' 8', ' 9']
Explanation: Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 all represent the same sorted sublist. To simplify the graph, we will keep the best among these, which will be determined by the score of each node.

Error: '<' not supported between instances of 'NoneType' and 'int'
===============================
Solving problem 12/100
===============================

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is unsorted and needs to be broken down into smaller sublists for easier management and sorting. We will split this list into two parts.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 6, 5, 3, 1, 7, 2, 8, 7, 2, 0, 5, 4, 5, 0, 5, 8, 0, 4, 8, 5, 9, 0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 0, 4, 4]'}

Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 are sublists derived from the main list in node 0 but have not yet been sorted or refined. To progress, we need to first sort these sublists.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 6, 5, 3, 1, 7, 2, 8, 7, 2, 0, 5, 4, 5, 0, 5, 8, 0, 4, 8, 5, 9, 0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 0, 4, 4]'}

(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to form a larger sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 6, 5, 3, 1, 7, 2, 8, 7, 2, 0, 5, 4, 5, 0, 5, 8, 0, 4, 8, 5, 9, 0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 0, 4, 4]'}

Step 3
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are already sorted sublists and have been aggregated into node 5. Now, we will score node 5 to assess if there are any mistakes in the sorted list.

Step 4
========================
Action: refine
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 is the result of aggregating nodes 3 and 4 and contains an almost sorted list but has a score of 2 indicating there are mistakes. We will refine this node to attempt to correct them.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 6, 5, 3, 1, 7, 2, 8, 7, 2, 0, 5, 4, 5, 0, 5, 8, 0, 4, 8, 5, 9, 0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 0, 4, 4]'}

(3, 5): {}
(4, 5): {}
(5, 6): {}


Step 5
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['6']
Explanation: Nodes 5 and 6 are both aggregates of the sorted sublists, however, Node 5 has a score which shows 2 mistakes while Node 6 has not been scored yet to assess its accuracy. To decide which one is more accurate, we'll first score Node 6 to compare their accuracies.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 6, 5, 3, 1, 7, 2, 8, 7, 2, 0, 5, 4, 5, 0, 5, 8, 0, 4, 8, 5, 9, 0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 0, 4, 4]'}

(5, 6): {}


Step 6
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Since nodes 3 and 4 are already sorted and represent split parts of the list from node 0, the next logical step is to aggregate these sorted lists into a single sorted list to see if they collectively form a correct solution.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 6, 5, 3, 1, 7, 2, 8, 7, 2, 0, 5, 4, 5, 0, 5, 8, 0, 4, 8, 5, 9, 0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 0, 4, 4]'}

Step 7
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['5', ' 6']
Explanation: Nodes 5 and 6 have been scored. We can compare their scores and keep the best one for further refinement or merging.

Step 8
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['7']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 8 contain aggregated sorted sublists. Node 8 has a score of 2, indicating some errors, while node 7 has not been scored yet. To decide which node is better, we need to score node 7.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 6, 5, 3, 1, 7, 2, 8, 7, 2, 0, 5, 4, 5, 0, 5, 8, 0, 4, 8, 5, 9, 0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 0, 4, 4]'}

Step 9
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 8 contain the same sorted list and have the same score. We will keep the best node and remove the duplicate to simplify the graph.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 6, 5, 3, 1, 7, 2, 8, 7, 2, 0, 5, 4, 5, 0, 5, 8, 0, 4, 8, 5, 9, 0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 0, 4, 4]'}

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 9): {}


Step 10
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['9']
Explanation: Node 9 seems to represent an aggregation of nodes 3 and 4 and contains only 2 mistakes according to its score. We should now check how closely it matches the ground truth.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 6, 5, 3, 1, 7, 2, 8, 7, 2, 0, 5, 4, 5, 0, 5, 8, 0, 4, 8, 5, 9, 0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 0, 4, 4]'}

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 9): {}


Step 11
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to create a larger sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 6, 5, 3, 1, 7, 2, 8, 7, 2, 0, 5, 4, 5, 0, 5, 8, 0, 4, 8, 5, 9, 0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 0, 4, 4]'}

Step 12
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['10']
Explanation: Node 9 and node 10 have the same sorted list but node 9 has a score and matches_ground_truth marked as False indicating there are errors. We should score node 10 to evaluate its accuracy.


Graph state:

Step 13
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['10']
Explanation: Nodes 9 and 10 have the same sorted list but only node 9 has been compared to the ground truth and found to have 2 mistakes. We should reevaluate node 10 with the groundtruth to verify if it matches the correct solution or also has mistakes.

Step 14
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to form a larger sorted list.

(4, 10): {}
(4, 11): {}


Step 15
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['11']
Explanation: Nodes 9, 10, and 11 are derived from node 3 and node 4 and have been attempted to represent a correctly aggregated sorted list. However, nodes 9 and 10 have been scored and marked as false against the ground truth. We need to score node 11 to evaluate its correctness.

(4, 11): {}


Step 16
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['9', ' 10', ' 11']
Explanation: Nodes 9, 10, and 11 all have the same sorted list but differ in scores and ground truth matching. To optimize the graph, I will use the keepbest operation to retain the best node among them and discard the rest.

Step 18
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['13']
Explanation: Node 12 and Node 13 contain the same sorted list but Node 12 has a score indicating the number of mistakes. Since we have a scored and an unscored version of the same list, it is beneficial to score node 13 to compare them accurately.

Step 19
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['12']
Explanation: Node 12 and 13 contain the same sorted list but we need to verify the correctness of the sorting. We will use the groundtruth operation on node 12 to compare it with the correct sorted list.

Step 21
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['12', ' 13']
Explanation: Node 12 and Node 13 have the same sorted list and have been scored. We will keep the best scored node and remove the other.

Step 22
========================
Action: refine
Nodes: ['15']
Explanation: Node 14 and 15 are aggregated, sorted sublists, but Node 15 has a score that indicates it has 2 mistakes. We should use the 'refine' operation on Node 15 to attempt to fix these mistakes, ensuring it is correctly sorted.

Step 25
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['14', ' 16']
Explanation: Nodes 14 and 16 are sorted sublists, and node 16 has a mistake count corresponding to a score of 2. To determine the best sorted list between node 14 and node 16, we will use the 'keepbest' operation to retain the node with the lowest number of mistakes.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 needs to be sorted. Since it is a long list, the first step is to split it into smaller sublists to simplify the sorting process.

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: The list in node 0 has been split into two sublists contained in nodes 1 and 2. To progress, we should sort both of these sublists.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[7, 0, 9, 2, 0, 6, 5, 9, 3, 5, 6, 2, 0, 1, 4, 7, 5, 7, 0, 9, 8, 2, 1, 3, 4, 4, 8, 4, 2, 7, 9, 7]'}

(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists resulting from the split sublists in nodes 1 and 2 respectively, so we will aggregate them to form a larger sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[7, 0, 9, 2, 0, 6, 5, 9, 3, 5, 6, 2, 0, 1, 4, 7, 5, 7, 0, 9, 8, 2, 1, 3, 4, 4, 8, 4, 2, 7, 9, 7]'}

Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 seems to contain a fully merged and sorted list from the sublists in node 3 and 4. To verify if it is correctly sorted as per the ground truth, we will use the groundtruth operation.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: Node 0 contains the initial unsorted list. To start sorting the list, I will split it into two smaller sublists to manage the sorting process more efficiently.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 4, 7, 1, 9, 8, 3, 0, 6, 4, 4, 1, 9, 9, 9, 2, 8, 4, 7, 4, 7, 9, 7, 6, 9, 7, 2, 1, 4, 5, 3, 1]'}

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Since nodes 1 and 2 represent two halves of the original list in node 0, they need to be sorted individually before they can be further processed or merged.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 4, 7, 1, 9, 8, 3, 0, 6, 4, 4, 1, 9, 9, 9, 2, 8, 4, 7, 4, 7, 9, 7, 6, 9, 7, 2, 1, 4, 5, 3, 1]'}

(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively, which were split from the original list in node 0. I will aggregate nodes 3 and 4 to form a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

Solving problem 15/100
===============================

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 needs to be sorted. It is currently unsorted, so the first step is to split the list into smaller sublists to simplify the sorting process.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 7, 0, 7, 8, 6, 3, 6, 6, 9, 8, 0, 3, 9, 3, 1, 7, 7, 4, 2, 5, 8, 2, 8, 7, 2, 1, 2, 6, 5, 5, 2]'}
1: {'thought': [8, 7, 0, 7, 8, 6, 3, 6, 6, 9, 8, 0, 3, 9, 3, 1], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [7, 7, 4, 2, 5, 8, 2, 8, 7, 2, 1, 2, 6, 5, 5, 2], 'score': None}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 are already split from node 0. In order to further decompose the problem, I will perform another split on these nodes to create smaller sublists that can be more easily sorted.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 7, 0, 7, 8, 6, 3, 6, 6, 9, 8, 0, 3, 9, 3, 1, 7, 7, 4, 2, 5, 8, 2, 8, 7, 2, 1, 2, 6, 5, 5, 2]'}
1: {'thought': [8, 7, 0, 7, 8, 6, 3, 6, 6, 9, 8, 0, 3, 9, 3, 1], 'score': None}

3: {'thought': [8, 7, 0, 7, 8, 6, 3, 6], 'score': None}
4: {'thought': [6, 9, 8, 0, 3, 9, 3, 1], 'score': None}
5: {'thought': [7, 7, 4, 2, 5, 8, 2, 8], 'score': None}
6: {'thought': [7, 2, 1, 2, 6, 5, 5, 2], 'score': None}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(1, 4): {}
(2, 5): {}
(2, 6): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['3']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 represent two halves of the first split from node 1, and need to be sorted individually before they can be aggregated.

Step 3
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are clearly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to form a larger sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 7, 0, 7, 8, 6, 3, 6, 6, 9, 8, 0, 3, 9, 3, 1, 7, 7, 4, 2, 5, 8, 2, 8, 7, 2, 1, 2, 6, 5, 5, 2]'}

Step 4
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['5', ' 6']
Explanation: Nodes 5 and 6 appear to be sublists that can be sorted individually. We will start by sorting these sublists to ensure they are in correct order before considering merging or further operations.

------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 7, 0, 7, 8, 6, 3, 6, 6, 9, 8, 0, 3, 9, 3, 1, 7, 7, 4, 2, 5, 8, 2, 8, 7, 2, 1, 2, 6, 5, 5, 2]'}

Step 6
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['11', ' 10']
Explanation: Nodes 11 and 10 contain sorted sublists, and we need to merge these smaller sorted sublists to form a larger sorted sublist.


Graph state:

Step 7
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['12']
Explanation: Node 12 appears to be a fully sorted list of all elements contained in the original list at node 0. To confirm if this is the correct solution, we will use the 'groundtruth' operation to compare it with the ground truth.

Step 8
========================
Action: refine
Nodes: ['12']
Explanation: Node 12 contains the full list but it is marked as not matching the ground truth. This indicates that while the list appears to be sorted correctly in terms of order, there may be discrepancies in the content or arrangement. We need to refine this node to fix existing mistakes.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: Node 0 contains a large unsorted list. To handle the sorting, it's practical to begin by splitting this list into smaller sublists which can then be individually sorted.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[9, 7, 1, 8, 7, 9, 5, 0, 9, 0, 6, 4, 5, 7, 0, 9, 2, 5, 8, 4, 3, 9, 6, 4, 6, 1, 7, 2, 2, 5, 3, 0]'}

(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Node 1 and 2 contain sublists split from node 0. To progress, we need to sort these sublists first.

Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to form a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[9, 7, 1, 8, 7, 9, 5, 0, 9, 0, 6, 4, 5, 7, 0, 9, 2, 5, 8, 4, 3, 9, 6, 4, 6, 1, 7, 2, 2, 5, 3, 0]'}

Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 is the result of aggregating nodes 3 and 4, and it contains a sorted list which is potentially the solution. We need to verify if it is correctly sorted according to the ground truth.

Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them.

Step 5
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['6']
Explanation: Node 5 and Node 6 are both aggregated results from nodes 3 and 4, but comparison with the ground truth has flagged node 5 as incorrect. We will now check if node 6 matches the correct sorted list.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: Since the list in node 0 is unsorted, the first step is to split this list into smaller sublists to handle them more manageably.

(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 contain different halves of the original unsorted list from node 0. To further decompose the problem, we should split these sublists into smaller parts.


Graph state:

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: To start solving the problem of sorting the list, we first need to decompose the problem into smaller parts. We will split the initial list in node 0 into two sublists for easier management.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[9, 7, 8, 2, 6, 2, 9, 7, 6, 8, 1, 0, 6, 3, 5, 0, 3, 6, 2, 4, 2, 0, 6, 8, 3, 1, 9, 7, 7, 2, 6, 4]'}
1: {'thought': [9, 7, 8, 2, 6, 2, 9, 7, 6, 8, 1, 0, 6, 3, 5, 0], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [3, 6, 2, 4, 2, 0, 6, 8, 3, 1, 9, 7, 7, 2, 6, 4], 'score': None}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 are the sublists of node 0, but we are unsure if they are sorted correctly. Therefore, let's score each sublist to identify how many mistakes each contains.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[9, 7, 8, 2, 6, 2, 9, 7, 6, 8, 1, 0, 6, 3, 5, 0, 3, 6, 2, 4, 2, 0, 6, 8, 3, 1, 9, 7, 7, 2, 6, 4]'}
1: {'thought': [9, 7, 8, 2, 6, 2, 9, 7, 6, 8, 1, 0, 6, 3, 5, 0], 'score': 25}
2: {'thought': [3, 6, 2, 4, 2, 0, 6, 8, 3, 1, 9, 7, 7, 2, 6, 4], 'score': 24}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 contain sublists that are potentially well-defined segments of the original list but are not sorted correctly, as indicated by their high scores. To progress, we should first sort these sublists.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[9, 7, 8, 2, 6, 2, 9, 7, 6, 8, 1, 0, 6, 3, 5, 0, 3, 6, 2, 4, 2, 0, 6, 8, 3, 1, 9, 7, 7, 2, 6, 4]'}

Step 7
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists of the initial list in node 0, and are potential candidates to create a complete sorted list. To proceed, we will aggregate these nodes to merge both sorted sublists into a single sorted list.

Step 8
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['5', ' 6', ' 7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8 are all sorted sublists derived from node 3 and 4. To determine the best merge candidate, I will score each to count the number of mistakes in their sorting.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 needs to be sorted. The first step in sorting the list is to break it down into smaller, more manageable sublists. This can be achieved by splitting the list.

Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to form a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 7, 6, 4, 5, 6, 4, 0, 2, 1, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 1, 8, 4, 4, 9, 7, 6, 0, 9, 6, 6, 1, 2, 5, 4, 7, 3]'}

Step 3
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2, respectively. Therefore, the next logical step would be to merge these two sorted sublists into a single sorted list.

Step 4
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Nodes 5 and 6 contain sorted sublists, which are derived from nodes 3 and 4. It's important to verify if these nodes match the ground truth to ascertain their correctness before potentially merging them.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 7, 6, 4, 5, 6, 4, 0, 2, 1, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 1, 8, 4, 4, 9, 7, 6, 0, 9, 6, 6, 1, 2, 5, 4, 7, 3]'}

Step 5
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to potentially get the complete sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 7, 6, 4, 5, 6, 4, 0, 2, 1, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 1, 8, 4, 4, 9, 7, 6, 0, 9, 6, 6, 1, 2, 5, 4, 7, 3]'}

Step 6
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['6', ' 7']
Explanation: Nodes 6 and 7 are both sorted sublists derived from the same original node (node 3). To determine which one is more accurately sorted according to the ground truth, I will score both nodes first.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 7, 6, 4, 5, 6, 4, 0, 2, 1, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 1, 8, 4, 4, 9, 7, 6, 0, 9, 6, 6, 1, 2, 5, 4, 7, 3]'}

Step 7
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['6', ' 7']
Explanation: Nodes 6 and 7 have both been scored with a score of 3. However, they contain differences in the number of elements. To determine the better solution, we need to compare them with the ground truth.

Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 7, 6, 4, 5, 6, 4, 0, 2, 1, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 1, 8, 4, 4, 9, 7, 6, 0, 9, 6, 6, 1, 2, 5, 4, 7, 3]'}

Step 8
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists of their respective original lists. We will aggregate these two sorted sublists to combine them into a single sorted list which might match the ground truth.

Step 15
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['11', ' 12', ' 13']
Explanation: Nodes 11, 12, and 13 all have sorted sublists with a score of 0, indicating no mistakes. To identify if any of these nodes match the ground truth, we should perform the 'groundtruth' operation on these nodes.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 needs to be sorted. To begin, we will split the list into two sublists to manage smaller sections at a time.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 6, 4, 0, 7, 9, 5, 2, 0, 4, 2, 4, 8, 4, 0, 3, 7, 0, 4, 3, 1, 3, 0, 1, 9, 6, 7, 4, 9, 1, 3, 0]'}
1: {'thought': [6, 6, 4, 0, 7, 9, 5, 2, 0, 4, 2, 4, 8, 4, 0, 3], 'score': None}

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 are still unsorted and contain the entire list split from node 0. To proceed with sorting, we need to sort each sublist.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 6, 4, 0, 7, 9, 5, 2, 0, 4, 2, 4, 8, 4, 0, 3, 7, 0, 4, 3, 1, 3, 0, 1, 9, 6, 7, 4, 9, 1, 3, 0]'}

Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists derived from the original list in node 0, so we will merge these sorted sublists together into a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 6, 4, 0, 7, 9, 5, 2, 0, 4, 2, 4, 8, 4, 0, 3, 7, 0, 4, 3, 1, 3, 0, 1, 9, 6, 7, 4, 9, 1, 3, 0]'}

5: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 5): {}
(4, 5): {}


Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 is the result of aggregating nodes 3 and 4, and it appears to be a sorted list of all the numbers originally contained in node 0. To confirm if node 5 is indeed the correct solution, we will compare it to the ground truth.


Graph state:

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 needs to be sorted, but before sorting, it can be beneficial to split the list into smaller sublists to manage the sorting process more efficiently.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 8, 0, 2, 7, 7, 9, 7, 9, 0, 6, 6, 8, 9, 1, 4, 2, 9, 6, 6, 2, 0, 0, 7, 5, 2, 5, 1, 3, 5, 2, 6]'}

(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 have been split from node 0, but need to be sorted before further operations. We will sort both nodes to progress towards a sorted list.

Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists of nodes 1 and 2, respectively. To move forward, we need to aggregate these sublists to form a larger sorted list.


Graph state:

Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to form a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 5, 0, 3, 6, 5, 6, 5, 4, 8, 0, 0, 7, 3, 9, 2, 9, 2, 0, 4, 1, 0, 5, 5, 8, 2, 8, 4, 4, 3, 5, 1]'}

(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 5): {}
(4, 5): {}


Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 appears to be an aggregation of well-sorted sublists from nodes 3 and 4, and it contains the same number of elements as the original list in node 0. The next step is to verify if this sorted list in node 5 matches the ground truth.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is unsorted and needs to be split into smaller sublists to simplify the sorting process.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 0, 5, 9, 3, 9, 2, 1, 7, 2, 1, 9, 7, 4, 8, 4, 2, 2, 9, 2, 1, 7, 3, 4, 4, 3, 3, 0, 8, 1, 8, 6]'}

Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 represent split sublists of the initial list in node 0. To progress towards sorting the entire list, we should start by sorting each of these sublists.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 0, 5, 9, 3, 9, 2, 1, 7, 2, 1, 9, 7, 4, 8, 4, 2, 2, 9, 2, 1, 7, 3, 4, 4, 3, 3, 0, 8, 1, 8, 6]'}

(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. To move towards solving the problem, we will merge these two sorted sublists into a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 0, 5, 9, 3, 9, 2, 1, 7, 2, 1, 9, 7, 4, 8, 4, 2, 2, 9, 2, 1, 7, 3, 4, 4, 3, 3, 0, 8, 1, 8, 6]'}

Step 3
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 represent sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. Before merging these sublists in node 5, it is essential to score nodes 3 and 4 to ensure they are sorted correctly without mistakes relative to their original unsorted sublists contained in nodes 1 and 2.

Step 4
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2, respectively. These nodes can be aggregated to form a larger sorted list.

Step 5
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. To progress towards solving the entire problem, these should be aggregated to form a larger sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 0, 5, 9, 3, 9, 2, 1, 7, 2, 1, 9, 7, 4, 8, 4, 2, 2, 9, 2, 1, 7, 3, 4, 4, 3, 3, 0, 8, 1, 8, 6]'}

Step 6
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['5', ' 6', ' 7']
Explanation: Nodes 5, 6, and 7 all contain the same sorted sublist. To proceed efficiently, we should keep the node with the highest score and discard the others. First, we need to score these nodes to identify which one has the fewest mistakes.


Graph state:
------------------------

Step 7
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['5', ' 6', ' 7']
Explanation: Nodes 5, 6, and 7 are duplicates with the same score. To simplify the graph, I will keep the best of these duplicates (which are essentially all the same in this case) and remove the rest.

========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists. We need to merge them to create a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 0, 5, 9, 3, 9, 2, 1, 7, 2, 1, 9, 7, 4, 8, 4, 2, 2, 9, 2, 1, 7, 3, 4, 4, 3, 3, 0, 8, 1, 8, 6]'}

Step 9
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. They are correctly sorted as indicated by their scores of 0. We will now aggregate nodes 3 and 4 to form a larger sorted sublist.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

(4, 10): {}


Step 10
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['9', ' 10']
Explanation: Nodes 9 and 10 have sorted lists that appear to be potential complete solutions but have not been scored yet. It's necessary to score these nodes to understand if they contain mistakes compared to their original lists.

Step 12
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are already sorted sublists of the original list. To further progress towards sorting the entire list, these should be merged into one list.

Step 13
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['9', ' 10']
Explanation: Nodes 9 and 10 contain sorted sublists, but they have different scores. To decide which node has the more accurate sorted list, we need to keep the one with the better score and discard the other.

Step 17
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are already sorted correctly as sublists, so the next step is to merge these sorted sublists into a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 0, 5, 9, 3, 9, 2, 1, 7, 2, 1, 9, 7, 4, 8, 4, 2, 2, 9, 2, 1, 7, 3, 4, 4, 3, 3, 0, 8, 1, 8, 6]'}

(4, 15): {}
(4, 16): {}


Step 18
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['16']
Explanation: Nodes 14 and 16 both have a score of 1 but they represent different lists. Node 14 is missing a '2' while Node 16 has an extra '2'. Scoring node 16 will allow us to compare and choose the best one.

Step 19
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['14', ' 16']
Explanation: Node 16 and node 14 have sorted lists but with different scores. To find out which of these represents the most accurate sorting, we should compare their scores.

Step 20
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['17']
Explanation: Node 17 contains a sorted list and has a score of 0, indicating no mistakes. It's a candidate for the correct solution. We should verify if it matches the ground truth.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The initial list in node 0 needs to be sorted. First, it should be split into smaller sublists to simplify the sorting process.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[9, 8, 8, 9, 8, 1, 9, 6, 5, 8, 0, 8, 5, 5, 5, 4, 3, 5, 8, 4, 0, 3, 3, 6, 6, 1, 4, 7, 0, 7, 2, 8]'}

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: The problem is to sort the list in ascending order. Node 0 contains the original unsorted list, and it has been split into two sublists contained in nodes 1 and 2. To proceed, we need to sort each sublist individually.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are the sorted sublists of nodes 1 and 2, respectively. To proceed, we should merge these sorted sublists to get closer to the final sorted list.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The problem requires sorting a list of numbers in ascending order. To manage the complexity, the first step is to break down the large list into smaller, more manageable sublists. Thus, we will split the list in node 0.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 0, 9, 6, 0, 7, 0, 2, 7, 8, 8, 9, 7, 5, 6, 0, 2, 3, 4, 9, 6, 4, 8, 9, 3, 5, 6, 2, 0, 1, 5, 3]'}

(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: We need to start by sorting the sublists in nodes 1 and 2 to progress towards a sorted version of the original list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to create a new node that combines both sorted lists.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 0, 9, 6, 0, 7, 0, 2, 7, 8, 8, 9, 7, 5, 6, 0, 2, 3, 4, 9, 6, 4, 8, 9, 3, 5, 6, 2, 0, 1, 5, 3]'}
1: {'thought': [3, 0, 9, 6, 0, 7, 0, 2, 7, 8, 8, 9, 7, 5, 6, 0], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [2, 3, 4, 9, 6, 4, 8, 9, 3, 5, 6, 2, 0, 1, 5, 3], 'score': None}
3: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [3, 0, 9, 6, 0, 7, 0, 2, 7, 8, 8, 9, 7, 5, 6, 0]}

5: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None}

(4, 5): {}


Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 seems to be the result of aggregating the sorted sublists from nodes 3 and 4. Now, to verify if node 5 contains the correct fully sorted list, we should compare it with the ground truth.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 0, 9, 6, 0, 7, 0, 2, 7, 8, 8, 9, 7, 5, 6, 0, 2, 3, 4, 9, 6, 4, 8, 9, 3, 5, 6, 2, 0, 1, 5, 3]'}
1: {'thought': [3, 0, 9, 6, 0, 7, 0, 2, 7, 8, 8, 9, 7, 5, 6, 0], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [2, 3, 4, 9, 6, 4, 8, 9, 3, 5, 6, 2, 0, 1, 5, 3], 'score': None}
3: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [3, 0, 9, 6, 0, 7, 0, 2, 7, 8, 8, 9, 7, 5, 6, 0]}
4: {'thought': '[0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [2, 3, 4, 9, 6, 4, 8, 9, 3, 5, 6, 2, 0, 1, 5, 3]}
5: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'matches_ground_truth': True}

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is unsorted and needs to be sorted. First, we'll split this list into smaller sublists to make the sorting process more manageable.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 4, 9, 0, 5, 9, 0, 8, 5, 5, 9, 2, 6, 4, 8, 1, 9, 1, 3, 9, 4, 6, 6, 9, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 1, 1, 4]'}
1: {'thought': [6, 4, 9, 0, 5, 9, 0, 8, 5, 5, 9, 2, 6, 4, 8, 1], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [9, 1, 3, 9, 4, 6, 6, 9, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 1, 1, 4], 'score': None}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: The initial list in node 0 has been split into two sublists in nodes 1 and 2. The next step is to sort each of these sublists to further analyze them.

(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. To progress towards solving the main problem, we should merge these sorted sublists to see if they collectively form a correctly sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 4, 9, 0, 5, 9, 0, 8, 5, 5, 9, 2, 6, 4, 8, 1, 9, 1, 3, 9, 4, 6, 6, 9, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 1, 1, 4]'}

2: {'thought': [9, 1, 3, 9, 4, 6, 6, 9, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 1, 1, 4], 'score': None}
3: {'thought': '[0, 0, 1, 2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [6, 4, 9, 0, 5, 9, 0, 8, 5, 5, 9, 2, 6, 4, 8, 1]}
4: {'thought': '[1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [9, 1, 3, 9, 4, 6, 6, 9, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 1, 1, 4]}
5: {'thought': '[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 5): {}
(4, 5): {}


Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 seems to be the result of aggregating nodes 3 and 4, but it lacks the final check against the ground truth to ensure it matches the correct sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 4, 9, 0, 5, 9, 0, 8, 5, 5, 9, 2, 6, 4, 8, 1, 9, 1, 3, 9, 4, 6, 6, 9, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 1, 1, 4]'}

3: {'thought': '[0, 0, 1, 2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [6, 4, 9, 0, 5, 9, 0, 8, 5, 5, 9, 2, 6, 4, 8, 1]}
4: {'thought': '[1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [9, 1, 3, 9, 4, 6, 6, 9, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 1, 1, 4]}
5: {'thought': '[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'matches_ground_truth': False}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 5): {}
(4, 5): {}


Step 4
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to attempt to form a correctly sorted list of the original array.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 4, 9, 0, 5, 9, 0, 8, 5, 5, 9, 2, 6, 4, 8, 1, 9, 1, 3, 9, 4, 6, 6, 9, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 1, 1, 4]'}

Step 5
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['6']
Explanation: Nodes 5 and 6 are both aggregates of nodes 3 and 4, but node 5 does not match the ground truth. We need to verify if node 6 matches the ground truth.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 4, 9, 0, 5, 9, 0, 8, 5, 5, 9, 2, 6, 4, 8, 1, 9, 1, 3, 9, 4, 6, 6, 9, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 1, 1, 4]'}

Step 6
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. The next logical step is to combine these sorted sublists to form a larger sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 4, 9, 0, 5, 9, 0, 8, 5, 5, 9, 2, 6, 4, 8, 1, 9, 1, 3, 9, 4, 6, 6, 9, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 1, 1, 4]'}

Step 7
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5', ' 6', ' 7']
Explanation: Nodes 5, 6, and 7 have not been compared with the ground truth yet. We need to use the 'groundtruth' operation to verify if they match the correct sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 4, 9, 0, 5, 9, 0, 8, 5, 5, 9, 2, 6, 4, 8, 1, 9, 1, 3, 9, 4, 6, 6, 9, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 1, 1, 4]'}

Step 8
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists that are derived from the split sublists of the original list in Node 0. To progress towards a complete sorted list, we will aggregate these two nodes to form a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

Step 9
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists of the original list in node 0, and their aggregated results are present in nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8. We need to verify which of these aggregated nodes correctly matches the ground truth.

Step 10
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, each derived from nodes 1 and 2 after splitting the original list in node 0. To proceed towards solving the problem, we should merge these sorted sublists.

Step 11
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 all appear to be sorted and contain similar lists. We need to verify if any of these nodes contain a list that matches the ground truth of the original list sorted in ascending order. Therefore, the next step would be to compare one of these nodes with the ground truth to see if it is correctly sorted.

Step 17
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['5', ' 6', ' 7', ' 8', ' 9', ' 10', ' 11', ' 12', ' 13', ' 14']
Explanation: Nodes 5 through 14 are all attempts to merge the sorted sublists from nodes 3 and 4, but they all have the same thought content and none are marked with 'matches_ground_truth: True'. We need to score them to determine if any of these merged lists are correctly sorted without mistakes.

Step 22
========================
Action: refine
Nodes: ['15']
Explanation: Node 15 has a score of 1 which indicates it has made a minor mistake in sorting. To correct this and ensure accuracy, we'll refine this node.

Step 23
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['15', ' 18']
Explanation: Node 15 and Node 18 both represent attempts to merge the sorted sublists from nodes 3 and 4, but they need to be scored to identify how many mistakes they contain in their sorted order.

Step 24
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['15', ' 16', ' 18']
Explanation: Nodes 15, 16, and 18 have been scored, showing varying numbers of mistakes. To proceed, we need to keep the node with the smallest number of mistakes to ensure the best sorted list.

Explanation: Node 19 seems to be an aggregated and sorted list that derives from node 3, which was a sorted version of node 1. Node 19 only has one mistake according to its score. I will use the 'groundtruth' operation to verify if node 19 matches the ground truth or if further refinement is required.

Step 28
========================
Action: refine
Nodes: ['19']
Explanation: Node 19 and node 20 both have scores indicating the number of mistakes, and node 19 has a lower score than node 20. Since node 19 has fewer mistakes, we will choose it for refining to fix the existing mistakes aiming to match the ground truth.

Step 29
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['21']
Explanation: The nodes 19 and 21 both have sorted lists derived from the original node 0 but with different scoring and details. Node 19 has a score of 1 and does not match the ground truth while node 21 has not been scored yet. We will score node 21 to evaluate how many errors it contains and to compare its performance against node 19.

========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['26', ' 27']
Explanation: Node 17 does not match the ground truth, while Node 25, despite having a low score indicating fewer mistakes, also does not match the ground truth. Nodes 26 and 27 are copies of each other, both containing sorted lists. To progress, we should score these nodes to evaluate their accuracy in sorting and then decide further steps based on their scores.

Step 49
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['33']
Explanation: Node 17 has been marked as not matching the ground truth, and node 32 has a score of 1 indicating it has one mistake when compared to the ground truth. Node 33 appears to be a refined version of node 32, but has not been scored yet. We should score node 33 to understand how many mistakes, if any, it contains.

Step 50
========================
Action: refine
Nodes: ['32']
Explanation: Node 17 does not match the ground truth, and nodes 32 and 33 have relatively low scores, indicating errors in their lists. Node 32 has a lower score indicating fewer mistakes compared to node 33. Thus, it will be beneficial to refine node 32 to attempt to correct the mistakes.

Step 52
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 represent correctly sorted sublists of the original list, and they are sorted in ascending order. We will merge these two nodes to create a larger sorted sublist.

Step 53
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['35', ' 36']
Explanation: Nodes 35 and 36 both contain the same list and only one needs to be kept for future operations. We will use the 'keepbest' operation to retain the node with the highest score and remove the other.

Error: '<' not supported between instances of 'NoneType' and 'int'
===============================
Solving problem 28/100
===============================

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is unsorted and needs to be broken down into smaller sublists to handle sorting more effectively.


Graph state:

Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 9, 6, 5, 2, 1, 2, 7, 6, 9, 6, 4, 7, 2, 9, 1, 6, 6, 1, 6, 4, 7, 1, 0, 5, 7, 6, 2, 2, 2, 4, 8]'}

Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 represent sublists that were split from node 0. To proceed, we need to sort each sublist individually.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 9, 6, 5, 2, 1, 2, 7, 6, 9, 6, 4, 7, 2, 9, 1, 6, 6, 1, 6, 4, 7, 1, 0, 5, 7, 6, 2, 2, 2, 4, 8]'}

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 represent sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2, which in turn are derived from the original list in node 0. To move towards solving the problem, these sorted sublists should be merged into a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 9, 6, 5, 2, 1, 2, 7, 6, 9, 6, 4, 7, 2, 9, 1, 6, 6, 1, 6, 4, 7, 1, 0, 5, 7, 6, 2, 2, 2, 4, 8]'}

(3, 5): {}
(4, 5): {}


Step 3
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to potentially create a correctly sorted full list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 9, 6, 5, 2, 1, 2, 7, 6, 9, 6, 4, 7, 2, 9, 1, 6, 6, 1, 6, 4, 7, 1, 0, 5, 7, 6, 2, 2, 2, 4, 8]'}

Step 4
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Nodes 5 and 6 are both sorted and appear to be aggregations of nodes 3 and 4. We will compare node 5 with the ground truth to check if it matches the correct sorted order of the entire list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 9, 6, 5, 2, 1, 2, 7, 6, 9, 6, 4, 7, 2, 9, 1, 6, 6, 1, 6, 4, 7, 1, 0, 5, 7, 6, 2, 2, 2, 4, 8]'}

(4, 6): {}


Step 5
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists of their respective original lists, so we will aggregate them to attempt to form a correctly sorted list of the entire original array.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 9, 6, 5, 2, 1, 2, 7, 6, 9, 6, 4, 7, 2, 9, 1, 6, 6, 1, 6, 4, 7, 1, 0, 5, 7, 6, 2, 2, 2, 4, 8]'}

Step 6
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 have been sorted correctly and are sublists derived from the original list in node 0. The next logical step is to merge these sorted sublists into a single sorted list using the aggregate operation.


Graph state:

Step 7
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists of the original list in node 0. Aggregating them will result in a single sorted list which could potentially be the correct sorted form of the entire list.

Step 9
========================
Action: aggregate

Step 10
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 represent two halves of the original list in node 0, each having been sorted. To produce a complete sorted list from the original, we need to merge these two sorted sublists.

Step 12
========================
Action: aggregate

Step 14
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['10']

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 needs to be sorted. First, we will split the list to break the problem into smaller parts.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 9, 5, 1, 3, 9, 0, 8, 0, 1, 9, 5, 8, 7, 3, 1, 6, 6, 2, 2, 0, 2, 7, 2, 5, 5, 5, 1, 6, 6, 9, 0]'}
1: {'thought': [3, 9, 5, 1, 3, 9, 0, 8, 0, 1, 9, 5, 8, 7, 3, 1], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [6, 6, 2, 2, 0, 2, 7, 2, 5, 5, 5, 1, 6, 6, 9, 0], 'score': None}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 contain two halves of the original list in node 0 and need to be sorted individually before they can be merged back into a full sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 9, 5, 1, 3, 9, 0, 8, 0, 1, 9, 5, 8, 7, 3, 1, 6, 6, 2, 2, 0, 2, 7, 2, 5, 5, 5, 1, 6, 6, 9, 0]'}
1: {'thought': [3, 9, 5, 1, 3, 9, 0, 8, 0, 1, 9, 5, 8, 7, 3, 1], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [6, 6, 2, 2, 0, 2, 7, 2, 5, 5, 5, 1, 6, 6, 9, 0], 'score': None}
3: {'thought': '[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [3, 9, 5, 1, 3, 9, 0, 8, 0, 1, 9, 5, 8, 7, 3, 1]}

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 appear to have correctly sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. Before merging these two nodes, it's prudent to score them individually to ensure they are sorted without errors.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 9, 5, 1, 3, 9, 0, 8, 0, 1, 9, 5, 8, 7, 3, 1, 6, 6, 2, 2, 0, 2, 7, 2, 5, 5, 5, 1, 6, 6, 9, 0]'}
1: {'thought': [3, 9, 5, 1, 3, 9, 0, 8, 0, 1, 9, 5, 8, 7, 3, 1], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [6, 6, 2, 2, 0, 2, 7, 2, 5, 5, 5, 1, 6, 6, 9, 0], 'score': None}
3: {'thought': '[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': 0, 'original': [3, 9, 5, 1, 3, 9, 0, 8, 0, 1, 9, 5, 8, 7, 3, 1]}
4: {'thought': '[0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 9]', 'score': 0, 'original': [6, 6, 2, 2, 0, 2, 7, 2, 5, 5, 5, 1, 6, 6, 9, 0]}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 3
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are already correctly sorted sublists as indicated by their scores of 0. Therefore, the next logical step is to aggregate these sorted sublists into a single sorted list.

Step 4
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 9, 5, 1, 3, 9, 0, 8, 0, 1, 9, 5, 8, 7, 3, 1, 6, 6, 2, 2, 0, 2, 7, 2, 5, 5, 5, 1, 6, 6, 9, 0]'}

Step 5
========================

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The initial list in node 0 is unsorted, and the problem is to sort it. We will start by splitting this list into smaller sublists to manage the sorting process in parts.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 9, 1, 7, 7, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 7, 0, 2, 0, 7, 8, 0, 1, 9, 2, 0, 4, 5, 6, 6, 1, 8, 9]'}
1: {'thought': [5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 9, 1, 7, 7, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 7, 0], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [2, 0, 7, 8, 0, 1, 9, 2, 0, 4, 5, 6, 6, 1, 8, 9], 'score': None}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 are sublists split from node 0. To proceed, I will sort both sublists to establish a basis for further operations.

(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists of their respective parent nodes, so we will aggregate them to form a potentially complete sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 9, 1, 7, 7, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 7, 0, 2, 0, 7, 8, 0, 1, 9, 2, 0, 4, 5, 6, 6, 1, 8, 9]'}

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 5): {}
(4, 5): {}


Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted sublists of the original list, and their aggregation has been stored in node 5. Now, we need to verify if the aggregated list in node 5 is correctly sorted and matches the ground truth.


Graph state:

(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 5): {}
(4, 5): {}


Step 4
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them.


Graph state:

Step 5
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5', ' 6']
Explanation: Nodes 5 and 6 are aggregated results of nodes 3 and 4. To verify if either of these nodes contains the correctly sorted list, we will perform the 'groundtruth' operation on both nodes.

Step 6
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to see if their combination results in a correctly sorted list of the entire original array.

Step 19
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists derived from the initial split of the main list in node 0. To progress towards the solution, I will merge these two sorted sublists into a single sorted list.

Step 21
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['5', ' 6']
Explanation: Nodes 5 and 6 both contain the same sorted sublist derived from node 3 but are marked as not matching the ground truth. It is necessary to check if there are any errors in merging these segments or if they indeed represent the correct sorted list. Therefore, we will score these nodes to count the number of mistakes in the sorting.

Step 27
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists derived from the original list in node 0. To progress towards sorting the entire list, we should merge these two sorted sublists.

Step 29
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists of the initial list split from node 0. We will now aggregate these two sorted lists to form a larger sorted sublist.

Step 34
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['7']
Explanation: Nodes 5 and 6 contain the same sorted lists but have been scored and identified as containing mistakes against the ground truth. Node 7 also contains a similar list but has not been scored yet. To proceed efficiently, we should score node 7 to verify its accuracy against the ground truth.

Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists derived from the original list in node 0. Node 3 sorts the first half, and node 4 sorts the second half of the original list. To move towards solving the problem of sorting the entire list, these two sublists should be merged into a single sorted list.

Step 36
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists of the original list split from node 0. To progress towards solving the problem of sorting the entire list, we should merge these two sorted sublists into a single sorted list using the aggregate operation.

Step 37
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Since nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists derived from node 0, the next logical step is to merge these two sorted sublists into a single sorted list. This will help in reconstructing the partially sorted version of the original list.

Step 39
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 have been split and sorted from the original list in node 0. These lists need to be merged to form a sorted list that combines their elements. Therefore, we will use the aggregate operation to combine these two sorted sublists.

Step 40
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain already sorted sublists of the initial list, divided into two parts. To progress towards a complete solution, I will aggregate these two sorted sublists to combine them into a single sorted list.

Step 41
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists of the original list from node 0. To combine these sorted sublists into a complete sorted list, I will perform an aggregation operation.

Step 45
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain correctly sorted sublists of the original list in node 0, so the next step is to aggregate these two sublists to form a larger sorted list.

Step 49
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['5', ' 6', ' 7']
Explanation: Nodes 5, 6, and 7 are identical and have been scored, but they do not match the ground truth. To simplify the graph, the 'keepbest' operation will be performed on these nodes, keeping only the best among them (they have equal scores in this case).

Step 51
========================
Action: refine
Nodes: ['47']
Explanation: We have a large number of sorted sublists that need further evaluation to determine if they are correctly sorted or if any adjustments are needed. Node 47 has a score, indicating it's closer to the correct solution but may still have errors. To refine this solution, I will perform a refine operation on node 47 to correct any leftover mistakes.

Step 52
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['48', ' 49']
Explanation: Nodes 47, 48, and 49 all seem to be sorted versions derived from the original list or parts of it. Node 47 has a score of 1, indicating a minor error, while nodes 48 and 49 don't have any score yet but are derived from the original list. To proceed, it would be prudent to score nodes 48 and 49 to evaluate their accuracy.

Step 59
========================
Action: refine
Nodes: ['48', ' 49']
Explanation: The current state shows multiple nodes have been sorted, but none have been verified against the ground truth to determine their correctness. Nodes 48 and 49 have scores which indicate the number of errors in their sorted lists. To progress, we need to refine these nodes to correct the mistakes.

Step 68
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists that represent the two halves of the original list in node 0. The next step is to merge these two sorted sublists into a single sorted list to get closer to a solution of the entire list.

Step 69
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['61', ' 63', ' 64', ' 65', ' 66']
Explanation: The nodes from 61 to 66 are sorted sublists originating from node 61, but they are not scored yet. To proceed effectively, we need to score these nodes to determine if they have been sorted correctly.

Step 72
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Node 0 contains the full unsorted list, which was split into two sublists in nodes 1 and 2. Both these sublists were sorted individually in nodes 3 and 4. The sorting results of these were further refined to produce nodes with sorted lists. Now, nodes 3 and 4 contain correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to form a single sorted list encompassing all elements.

Step 74
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['61', ' 71']
Explanation: Nodes 61 and 71 have individual sorted sublists with a score indicating only 1 mistake in each. To identify the best sorted list between these two, we will score these nodes and then employ the keepbest operation to retain the node with the highest score (i.e., lowest number of mistakes).

Step 75
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists that were derived from the initial list in node 0. To progress towards the solution, we need to combine these sorted sublists into a larger sorted list. The aggregation operation is suitable for this purpose.

Step 78
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sublists that were derived from node 0 and sorted correctly. These sublists together should cover the entire list from node 0 when combined correctly. To verify this, the next logical step is to aggregate these two sorted sublists into a single sorted list.

Step 82
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists derived from the initial list in node 0. To move towards solving the problem, these sublists need to be combined to form a larger sorted list. Therefore, I will aggregate these two nodes to merge their sorted sublists.

Step 83
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: The nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists that were derived from the original list in node 0. I will now aggregate these two nodes to form a single sorted list which combines both sublists.

Step 84
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 represent sorted sublists derived from node 0, which contains the entire list. To proceed towards the solution, we should now aggregate these two sorted sublists to form a larger sorted segment that is closer to the final solution.

Step 86
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 each contain sorted sublists derived from the initial list in node 0. To move towards a complete solution, we need to combine these sorted sublists. We'll use the aggregate action to merge nodes 3 and 4 into a single sorted list.

Step 90
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted sublists that together form the original list found in node 0. To proceed towards solving the problem, we need to merge these sorted sublists into a single sorted list. This can be achieved by aggregating nodes 3 and 4.

Step 93
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['3']
Explanation: We need to verify if the sorted lists in nodes 3 and 4 are correct by comparing them against the ground truth. Both nodes were created by sorting sublists derived from the original list in node 0. I will start by checking node 3.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 needs to be sorted. To begin solving this problem, we will first split the list into smaller sublists to make the sorting manageable.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 2, 6, 4, 7, 2, 5, 2, 8, 4, 9, 5, 7, 7, 3, 2, 5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 8, 2, 8, 2, 6, 5, 3, 3, 5, 8, 4]'}

Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 contain two halves of the original list from node 0. To proceed, let's sort both sublists to further assess their correctness.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 2, 6, 4, 7, 2, 5, 2, 8, 4, 9, 5, 7, 7, 3, 2, 5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 8, 2, 8, 2, 6, 5, 3, 3, 5, 8, 4]'}
1: {'thought': [4, 2, 6, 4, 7, 2, 5, 2, 8, 4, 9, 5, 7, 7, 3, 2], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 8, 2, 8, 2, 6, 5, 3, 3, 5, 8, 4], 'score': None}
3: {'thought': '[2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [4, 2, 6, 4, 7, 2, 5, 2, 8, 4, 9, 5, 7, 7, 3, 2]}
4: {'thought': '[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 8, 8, 8]', 'score': None, 'original': [5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 8, 2, 8, 2, 6, 5, 3, 3, 5, 8, 4]}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively, and represent the entire list divided into two parts. We will now aggregate these two sorted parts to create a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 2, 6, 4, 7, 2, 5, 2, 8, 4, 9, 5, 7, 7, 3, 2, 5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 8, 2, 8, 2, 6, 5, 3, 3, 5, 8, 4]'}
1: {'thought': [4, 2, 6, 4, 7, 2, 5, 2, 8, 4, 9, 5, 7, 7, 3, 2], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 8, 2, 8, 2, 6, 5, 3, 3, 5, 8, 4], 'score': None}
3: {'thought': '[2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [4, 2, 6, 4, 7, 2, 5, 2, 8, 4, 9, 5, 7, 7, 3, 2]}
4: {'thought': '[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 8, 8, 8]', 'score': None, 'original': [5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 8, 2, 8, 2, 6, 5, 3, 3, 5, 8, 4]}
5: {'thought': '[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9]', 'score': None}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 5): {}
(4, 5): {}


Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 seems to contain a fully merged and sorted list of the original numbers but needs to be verified against the ground truth to confirm it is sorted correctly.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 2, 6, 4, 7, 2, 5, 2, 8, 4, 9, 5, 7, 7, 3, 2, 5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 8, 2, 8, 2, 6, 5, 3, 3, 5, 8, 4]'}
1: {'thought': [4, 2, 6, 4, 7, 2, 5, 2, 8, 4, 9, 5, 7, 7, 3, 2], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 8, 2, 8, 2, 6, 5, 3, 3, 5, 8, 4], 'score': None}
3: {'thought': '[2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [4, 2, 6, 4, 7, 2, 5, 2, 8, 4, 9, 5, 7, 7, 3, 2]}

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The current node contains a list that needs to be sorted. A common method to handle sorting is to break down the list into smaller parts, sort each, and then combine them. Let's start by splitting the list into two smaller sublists for easier management.

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: The initial list in node 0 has been split into two sublists in nodes 1 and 2. These sublists are not sorted and need to be sorted first before any further operations.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 6, 2, 2, 9, 8, 7, 2, 5, 3, 5, 7, 1, 3, 4, 0, 3, 6, 9, 1, 6, 1, 0, 4, 1, 2, 6, 7, 7, 6, 9, 1]'}

(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists of nodes 1 and 2 respectively. To progress towards solving the problem, we should merge these two sorted sublists to form a larger sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 6, 2, 2, 9, 8, 7, 2, 5, 3, 5, 7, 1, 3, 4, 0, 3, 6, 9, 1, 6, 1, 0, 4, 1, 2, 6, 7, 7, 6, 9, 1]'}

Step 4
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to see if their combination gives the correct larger sorted list.

Step 5
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['5', ' 6', ' 7']
Explanation: Node 5, 6, and 7 are all sorted sublists derived from node 3, but their contents differ slightly. To determine which one is most accurate, we need to score each of them to find out how many mistakes they contain.

Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are already sorted sublists of the original list split from node 0. To combine these sorted sublists back into a complete sorted list, we should aggregate them.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is unsorted. To begin sorting it, we need to split the list into smaller sublists which can be managed more easily.


Graph state:

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 are sublists of Node 0, and they need to be sorted next.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sublists that have been sorted. In order to proceed towards sorting the entire list, we need to merge these sublists into a single sorted list.


Graph state:

Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted versions of the sublists from nodes 1 and 2, and they have been further merged into node 5. To verify whether node 5 is completely sorted correctly, we need to compare it with the ground truth.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

Step 4
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 have been sorted correctly according to their original sublists. To proceed towards a complete and correctly sorted list, we will merge these sorted sublists.


Graph state:

Step 5
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively, which originally split from node 0. To move towards the solution, we need to combine these sorted sublists into one sorted list.

Step 8
========================
Action: score

Explanation: Nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8 are all sorted sublists resulting from different operations on the original list but they do not match the ground truth, indicating potential mistakes in them. Since they are refined versions of the sorted sublist, it will be beneficial to score them to identify the number of mistakes in each sublist and keep the best one.

Step 11
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['9', ' 10']
Explanation: Nodes 9 and 10 look like they are attempts to merge the sorted sublists from nodes 3 and 4, but they have different scores. To determine the best merged solution, we should compare the scores and keep the node with the better score.

Step 4
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 appears to be an aggregation of nodes 3 and 4, which are sorted sublists of the original list in node 0. We need to verify if node 5 matches the correctly sorted ground truth of the original list.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is unsorted and needs to be broken down into smaller parts to make sorting manageable.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 9, 1, 5, 7, 4, 2, 6, 2, 8, 8, 9, 3, 0, 6, 7, 7, 8, 6, 5, 8, 3, 3, 0, 1, 6, 4, 0, 8, 8, 1, 7]'}

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 are unsorted sublists that have been split from the original list in node 0. To further handle the sorting, we should sort each of these sublists individually.

Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 contains an aggregation of nodes 3 and 4 and is a candidate for the correct sorted sequence of the original list. We should verify it by comparing it to the ground truth to ensure its correctness.

Step 4
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to form a larger sorted list.

Step 5
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are already sorted sublists of the original list in node 0. To move towards the solution, we will merge these two sorted sublists to create a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 9, 1, 5, 7, 4, 2, 6, 2, 8, 8, 9, 3, 0, 6, 7, 7, 8, 6, 5, 8, 3, 3, 0, 1, 6, 4, 0, 8, 8, 1, 7]'}

Step 6
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['5', ' 6', ' 7']
Explanation: Nodes 5, 6, and 7 are aggregated results of nodes 3 and 4, which are correctly sorted sublists of nodes 1 and 2 respectively. To determine the best among nodes 5, 6, and 7, we need to score them to count the number of mistakes in each.

Step 7
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Nodes 5, 6, and 7 all have the same thought and score, but they have not been compared against the ground truth to check if they match the correct sorted list. We will perform the groundtruth operation on one of these nodes to verify if the sorted list matches the ground truth.

Step 8
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['5', ' 6', ' 7']
Explanation: Nodes 5, 6, and 7 contain sorted sublists but have the same score. We need to keep the best among them and delete the rest.

Step 10
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['8']
Explanation: Nodes 8 and 9 are derived from the initial list and are sorted but need to be compared to the ground truth to ascertain correctness. Let's check if node 8, which has the highest score among sorted lists, matches the ground truth.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 8): {}
(8, 9): {}


Step 11
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['9']
Explanation: Node 9 already has a sorted list but hasn't been scored or compared to the ground truth. Let's score it to evaluate how many mistakes it contains.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 9, 1, 5, 7, 4, 2, 6, 2, 8, 8, 9, 3, 0, 6, 7, 7, 8, 6, 5, 8, 3, 3, 0, 1, 6, 4, 0, 8, 8, 1, 7]'}

8: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': 1, 'matches_ground_truth': False}
9: {'thought': '[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': 2, 'original': '[8, 9, 1, 5, 7, 4, 2, 6, 2, 8, 8, 9, 3, 0, 6, 7, 7, 8, 6, 5, 8, 3, 3, 0, 1, 6, 4, 0, 8, 8, 1, 7]'}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 8): {}
(8, 9): {}


Step 12
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. To progress towards a fully sorted list, we need to merge these sorted sublists.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 9, 1, 5, 7, 4, 2, 6, 2, 8, 8, 9, 3, 0, 6, 7, 7, 8, 6, 5, 8, 3, 3, 0, 1, 6, 4, 0, 8, 8, 1, 7]'}
1: {'thought': [8, 9, 1, 5, 7, 4, 2, 6, 2, 8, 8, 9, 3, 0, 6, 7], 'score': None}

8: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': 1, 'matches_ground_truth': False}
9: {'thought': '[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': 2, 'original': '[8, 9, 1, 5, 7, 4, 2, 6, 2, 8, 8, 9, 3, 0, 6, 7, 7, 8, 6, 5, 8, 3, 3, 0, 1, 6, 4, 0, 8, 8, 1, 7]'}
10: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': None}

(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 8): {}
(3, 10): {}
(4, 10): {}
(8, 9): {}


Step 13
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['10']
Explanation: Nodes 8 and 10 both contain sorted lists derived from the same original list (node 0). Node 8 has a score of 1 and node 10 has not been scored yet. To decide which node represents the correct or better sorted list, we need to score node 10.

Step 14
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['8', ' 9', ' 10']
Explanation: Node 8 and 10 both contain sorted lists but with scores indicating slight discrepancies. Node 9, derived from node 8, has more mistakes than node 10. To streamline the thought graph and keep only the best representation of the sorted list, we should perform the 'keepbest' operation on nodes 8, 9, and 10.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

Step 15
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

Step 16
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists of the original list. Therefore, it is appropriate to merge these two sorted sublists to attempt to form a larger sorted list.

Step 17
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['12', ' 13']
Explanation: Nodes 11, 12, and 13 all have the same sorted thought but only node 11 has been scored. To continue, we need to score nodes 12 and 13 to compare and find the best sorted list.

Step 18
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['11', ' 12', ' 13']
Explanation: Nodes 11, 12, and 13 have the same thought but different score values. To focus on the most promising node and simplify the graph, we will use the 'keepbest' operation on these nodes.


Graph state:

Step 19
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to create a combined sorted list.

------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 9, 1, 5, 7, 4, 2, 6, 2, 8, 8, 9, 3, 0, 6, 7, 7, 8, 6, 5, 8, 3, 3, 0, 1, 6, 4, 0, 8, 8, 1, 7]'}

Step 20
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. By aggregating nodes 3 and 4, we will merge their sorted lists into a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 9, 1, 5, 7, 4, 2, 6, 2, 8, 8, 9, 3, 0, 6, 7, 7, 8, 6, 5, 8, 3, 3, 0, 1, 6, 4, 0, 8, 8, 1, 7]'}

16: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': None}

Step 21
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['14', ' 15']
Explanation: Nodes 14 and 15 both contain the same sorted list and need to be scored to determine their accuracy. I will score these nodes to find out the number of mistakes in each.

Step 22
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['14', ' 15']
Explanation: Nodes 14 and 15 contain similar sorted lists and both have a score of 1. To simplify our graph and focus on the best potential solutions, we will perform the 'keepbest' operation to keep only one of these similar scored nodes.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

17: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': 1}

(4, 16): {}


Step 23
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 both contain sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2. To proceed towards a solution, we should combine these sorted sublists into one sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 9, 1, 5, 7, 4, 2, 6, 2, 8, 8, 9, 3, 0, 6, 7, 7, 8, 6, 5, 8, 3, 3, 0, 1, 6, 4, 0, 8, 8, 1, 7]'}

(4, 18): {}


Step 24
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['16', ' 18']
Explanation: Nodes 16, 17, and 18 have been sorted, but only node 17 has been scored and contains a mistake. To determine which of the remaining nodes is the best, we need to score nodes 16 and 18.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 9, 1, 5, 7, 4, 2, 6, 2, 8, 8, 9, 3, 0, 6, 7, 7, 8, 6, 5, 8, 3, 3, 0, 1, 6, 4, 0, 8, 8, 1, 7]'}

16: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': 1}
17: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': 1}

(4, 16): {}
(4, 18): {}


Step 25
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['16', ' 17', ' 18']
Explanation: Nodes 16, 17, and 18 all contain the same sorted list with a score of 1. To streamline the graph, it is efficient to keep only one of these nodes and remove the duplicates. Therefore, I will use the 'keepbest' operation to retain the node with the highest score (or in this case, any, as they all have the same score).

Step 27
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted sublists of node 1 and node 2 respectively. These two sublists cover the entire list in node 0 when combined. To proceed towards solving the problem, we should merge these sorted sublists into a single list.

Step 28
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['20', ' 21']
Explanation: Nodes 19, 20, and 21 all seem to contain the same sorted list but only node 19 has a score which indicates one mistake. To verify which of these nodes has the correct sorting, I need to score nodes 20 and 21.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 9, 1, 5, 7, 4, 2, 6, 2, 8, 8, 9, 3, 0, 6, 7, 7, 8, 6, 5, 8, 3, 3, 0, 1, 6, 4, 0, 8, 8, 1, 7]'}

(4, 21): {}


Step 29
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['19', ' 20', ' 21']
Explanation: Nodes 19, 20, and 21 are duplicates and have the same score. We should keep the best one, which is technically any of them since they have the same score.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 9, 1, 5, 7, 4, 2, 6, 2, 8, 8, 9, 3, 0, 6, 7, 7, 8, 6, 5, 8, 3, 3, 0, 1, 6, 4, 0, 8, 8, 1, 7]'}

(0, 2): {}

(2, 4): {}
(3, 22): {}


Step 30
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['22']
Explanation: Node 22 seems to be a sorted version of the original list, but it has a score indicating one mistake. To verify if it's correct or to identify the discrepancy, we should use the 'groundtruth' operation on node 22.

Step 31
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists. To proceed with the problem solution, we will aggregate these two nodes to form a larger sorted list.

Step 32
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['23']
Explanation: Node 22 and 23 seem to contain similar sorted lists, but node 22 has a score indicating it has one mistake. We should score node 23 to compare their quality.


Graph state:

Step 33
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['22', ' 23']
Explanation: Nodes 22 and 23 are similar and both have been scored with the same score. We should keep the node that matches the ground truth and delete the rest.

Step 34
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists of nodes 1 and 2 respectively, so we will aggregate them to start forming the sorted list.

Step 35
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['24', ' 25']
Explanation: Node 24 and Node 25 seem to contain the same sorted list but Node 24 has been scored. To simplify and reduce redundancy, we should keep the node with the score.

Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 are sublists that originated from node 0. To proceed, each sublist should be sorted.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is unsorted and contains duplicates. We will split it into two sublists to manage the sorting process more easily.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 1, 1, 8, 1, 7, 9, 1, 5, 5, 1, 9, 0, 8, 7, 7, 9, 0, 7, 0, 4, 9, 8, 5, 9, 6, 6, 2, 6, 5, 1, 1]'}

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 represent sublists of the original list in node 0. To better understand these sublists, I will first sort each of these sublists to see how they look when sorted.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 1, 1, 8, 1, 7, 9, 1, 5, 5, 1, 9, 0, 8, 7, 7, 9, 0, 7, 0, 4, 9, 8, 5, 9, 6, 6, 2, 6, 5, 1, 1]'}

Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively, which in turn come from the original list in node 0. To proceed towards solving the problem, we need to aggregate these sorted sublists to form a larger sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 1, 1, 8, 1, 7, 9, 1, 5, 5, 1, 9, 0, 8, 7, 7, 9, 0, 7, 0, 4, 9, 8, 5, 9, 6, 6, 2, 6, 5, 1, 1]'}

(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 5): {}
(4, 5): {}


Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 appears to be the result of aggregating nodes 3 and 4 which were sorted sublists of nodes 1 and 2. To verify if node 5 contains the correct sorted list, we should compare it with the ground truth.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The problem requires sorting the list in ascending order, and currently, there is only one node containing the entire unsorted list. We should start by splitting this list into smaller sublists to manage the sorting process more effectively.

Step 1
========================
Action: sort

Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively, so we will aggregate them to approach a full sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[2, 1, 6, 3, 9, 3, 8, 3, 2, 3, 9, 9, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 9, 3, 4, 3, 3, 5, 4, 4, 4, 9, 7, 8, 3, 0, 8]'}

5: {'thought': '[0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 5): {}
(4, 5): {}


Step 3
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. Next, we will merge these sorted sublists to create a larger sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[2, 1, 6, 3, 9, 3, 8, 3, 2, 3, 9, 9, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 9, 3, 4, 3, 3, 5, 4, 4, 4, 9, 7, 8, 3, 0, 8]'}

3: {'thought': '[1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [2, 1, 6, 3, 9, 3, 8, 3, 2, 3, 9, 9, 5, 4, 3, 2]}
4: {'thought': '[0, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [1, 9, 3, 4, 3, 3, 5, 4, 4, 4, 9, 7, 8, 3, 0, 8]}
5: {'thought': '[0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None}
6: {'thought': '[0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None}

(4, 6): {}


Step 4
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['5', ' 6']
Explanation: Nodes 5 and 6 contain sorted sublists that seem to be identical. To confirm this, I will perform a 'score' operation on both to identify any mistakes in the sorting.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[2, 1, 6, 3, 9, 3, 8, 3, 2, 3, 9, 9, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 9, 3, 4, 3, 3, 5, 4, 4, 4, 9, 7, 8, 3, 0, 8]'}

Step 5
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['5', ' 6']
Explanation: Nodes 5 and 6 are both sorted sublists derived from the same original sublists with the same score. It would be efficient to keep the best one (or either, since they have the same score) and remove the other to reduce redundancy.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[2, 1, 6, 3, 9, 3, 8, 3, 2, 3, 9, 9, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 9, 3, 4, 3, 3, 5, 4, 4, 4, 9, 7, 8, 3, 0, 8]'}

(3, 7): {}


Step 6
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['7']
Explanation: Node 7 is a merged sorted list and seems close to the final solution except for one mistake in sorting. Let's verify if it matches the ground truth.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[2, 1, 6, 3, 9, 3, 8, 3, 2, 3, 9, 9, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 9, 3, 4, 3, 3, 5, 4, 4, 4, 9, 7, 8, 3, 0, 8]'}

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 7): {}


Step 7
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 represent sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2, respectively. These sublists cover the entire array from node 0 when combined. To progress towards solving the problem, these sorted sublists should be merged into a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[2, 1, 6, 3, 9, 3, 8, 3, 2, 3, 9, 9, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 9, 3, 4, 3, 3, 5, 4, 4, 4, 9, 7, 8, 3, 0, 8]'}

8: {'thought': '[0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None}

Step 8
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. The next logical step would be to merge these two sorted sublists (nodes 3 and 4) into a single sorted list to solve the problem further.

Step 9
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists based on their original nodes, so we will aggregate them to create a single sorted list from the original list.

Step 10
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['8', ' 9', ' 10']
Explanation: Node 7 has been scored and marked as not matching the ground truth. Now I will score nodes 8, 9, and 10 to see if any of them correctly represent the sorted list.

Step 11
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['7', ' 8', ' 9', ' 10']
Explanation: Nodes 7, 8, 9, and 10 all have the same sorted list with a score of 1 but do not match the ground truth. We will keep the best node among them, which has the highest score, and remove the redundant nodes to simplify the graph.

Step 12
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. To continue solving the problem, we need to merge these sorted sublists into one.

Step 13
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['11']
Explanation: Nodes 11 and 12 both seem to represent attempts to sort the entire list, but neither has been checked against the ground truth yet. Before proceeding with any further actions, it is essential to verify if either of these nodes matches the ground truth.

Step 14
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 represent sorted sublists of the original list in node 0. To combine them into a full sorted list, we will use the aggregate operation.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[2, 1, 6, 3, 9, 3, 8, 3, 2, 3, 9, 9, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 9, 3, 4, 3, 3, 5, 4, 4, 4, 9, 7, 8, 3, 0, 8]'}

(4, 13): {}


Step 15
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 represent correctly sorted sublists of the original list. To proceed towards the solution, we need to combine these sorted sublists into one.

Step 16
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['12', ' 13', ' 14']
Explanation: Nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14 are derived from node 3 and seem to represent attempts at aggregating the sorted sublists. However, only node 11 has been scored and doesn't match the ground truth. We need to score nodes 12, 13, and 14 to understand if any of these represent the correct solution.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The initial list in node 0 is unsorted. We need to start by splitting this list into smaller sublists to simplify sorting.

Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to form one single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 5, 6, 4, 3, 7, 3, 0, 6, 9, 1, 0, 1, 7, 0, 1, 8, 6, 5, 9, 5, 9, 4, 2, 5, 3, 8, 8, 8, 0, 9, 7]'}

5: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None}

(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 5): {}
(4, 5): {}


Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 appears to contain the complete list aggregated from nodes 3 and 4, which were sorted sublists. We now need to verify if node 5 indeed contains the correct sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 5, 6, 4, 3, 7, 3, 0, 6, 9, 1, 0, 1, 7, 0, 1, 8, 6, 5, 9, 5, 9, 4, 2, 5, 3, 8, 8, 8, 0, 9, 7]'}

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 5): {}
(4, 5): {}


Step 4
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists that were derived from nodes 1 and 2, respectively. To see if merging these two sorted sublists results in a correctly sorted entire list, we will aggregate them.


Graph state:

Nodes:

6: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None}

Step 5
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists of the original list split in nodes 1 and 2. We will aggregate them to form a larger sorted list.

Step 6
========================

Step 10
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['5', ' 6', ' 7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8 are duplicates, each containing a sorted list. We need to keep only one node of the best or correct sorted list among these duplicates, and remove the rest for clarity and to simplify the graph.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 needs to be sorted. First, we should decompose the problem by splitting the list into smaller sublists.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[9, 2, 6, 8, 4, 0, 5, 0, 8, 6, 1, 6, 6, 6, 7, 6, 5, 2, 3, 4, 3, 9, 2, 9, 3, 2, 0, 0, 1, 4, 6, 6]'}

(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: We need to sort the sublists to progress towards the solution. I will sort each sublist in nodes 1 and 2.


Graph state:

Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. We will aggregate them to form a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[9, 2, 6, 8, 4, 0, 5, 0, 8, 6, 1, 6, 6, 6, 7, 6, 5, 2, 3, 4, 3, 9, 2, 9, 3, 2, 0, 0, 1, 4, 6, 6]'}

Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 appears to contain the entire sorted list. To verify if it matches the ground truth, we will perform the 'groundtruth' operation.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[9, 2, 6, 8, 4, 0, 5, 0, 8, 6, 1, 6, 6, 6, 7, 6, 5, 2, 3, 4, 3, 9, 2, 9, 3, 2, 0, 0, 1, 4, 6, 6]'}

Step 4
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists and are results of sublists from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. To move towards solving the whole list, we need to aggregate these sorted sublists.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[9, 2, 6, 8, 4, 0, 5, 0, 8, 6, 1, 6, 6, 6, 7, 6, 5, 2, 3, 4, 3, 9, 2, 9, 3, 2, 0, 0, 1, 4, 6, 6]'}

Step 6
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['5', ' 6', ' 7']
Explanation: Nodes 3, 6, and 7 contain sorted sublists derived from node 1. Node 3 is already confirmed as correctly sorted and forms the basis for nodes 5, 6, and 7. To simplify, we should keep the best version of these similar nodes.

(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are already sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. We will merge these sorted sublists to create a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[0, 1, 6, 5, 4, 6, 9, 3, 7, 0, 0, 1, 1, 6, 7, 1, 9, 9, 4, 5, 9, 1, 2, 2, 7, 5, 6, 1, 9, 1, 2, 4]'}

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 5): {}
(4, 5): {}


Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 seems to be the result of aggregating nodes 3 and 4 which are sorted sublists of nodes 1 and 2 respectively. To verify if node 5 contains the correctly sorted list, we will compare it to the ground truth.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is unsorted and needs to be broken down into smaller sublists to handle sorting effectively. I will split it into two sublists for further processing.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[1, 8, 6, 5, 0, 6, 2, 4, 2, 2, 0, 8, 7, 6, 1, 3, 1, 9, 7, 5, 9, 8, 1, 8, 2, 7, 7, 3, 7, 7, 8, 7]'}

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Node 0 contains the entire unsorted list. To simplify the sorting task, it has already been split into two sublists contained in nodes 1 and 2. The next step is to sort each of these sublists individually.

Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 seems to contain a sorted list of all the elements from the original list in node 0. To verify its correctness, we should compare it with the ground truth.

Step 0
========================

Step 1
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 are unsorted sublists, so we will score them to determine the number of mistakes in each list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 7, 0, 6, 4, 5, 0, 3, 0, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 6, 5, 5, 9, 7, 1, 0, 8, 0, 4, 9, 1, 3, 5, 1, 7, 2, 0]'}
1: {'thought': [4, 7, 0, 6, 4, 5, 0, 3, 0, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 6, 5], 'score': 23}

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: refine
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 are incorrect as they both have a high number of mistakes in their sorting. Therefore, we should refine these sublists to reduce the number of mistakes.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 7, 0, 6, 4, 5, 0, 3, 0, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 6, 5, 5, 9, 7, 1, 0, 8, 0, 4, 9, 1, 3, 5, 1, 7, 2, 0]'}

(2, 4): {}


Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['3']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 both have the same sorted list and originate from the same unsorted list, which means they should contain the correct sorted order of the original list in node 0. To verify this, we will use the 'groundtruth' operation on node 3 to compare it with the ground truth.

Step 8
========================

Step 9
========================

Step 18
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['6']
Explanation: Nodes 6 and 7 have low scores, indicating they have fewer mistakes compared to other nodes. They seem close to the correct sorted list but require validation to ensure they match the ground truth. We will check if node 6 matches the ground truth.

Step 21
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['6', ' 7']
Explanation: Nodes 6 and 7 have the same sorted list with a low score of 2, indicating fewer mistakes. To see if either of these nodes provides the correct solution, we will use the 'groundtruth' operation on both to check if they match the expected ground truth.

Step 22
========================
Action: refine
Nodes: ['6', ' 7']
Explanation: Node 6 and Node 7 both have a score of 2, suggesting they are close to being correct but contain a few mistakes. To determine which one is more accurate, we need to refine both and then score them to compare their accuracy.

Step 34
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 9']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 9 both have sublists that scored very low on mistakes (score: 2), suggesting they are nearly correct. Therefore, it is efficient to aggregate these two nodes to form a more complete sorted list.

Step 35
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['6', ' 7']
Explanation: Nodes 6 and 7 have the lowest number of sorting mistakes, each having a score of 2. This suggests they are closest to the correct sorting of their respective sublists. I will compare these nodes with the ground truth to check if they match the correct sorted list, and if not, they can be refined or corrected further.

Step 37
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['6', ' 7']
Explanation: Node 6 and Node 7 both have a score of 2, indicating only two mistakes each. These nodes are the most accurately sorted among the nodes that have been scored. To progress towards a solution, we should aggregate these two nodes to see if combining them results in a more accurate sorted list.

Step 38
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['6', ' 7']
Explanation: Nodes 6 and 7 have the highest scores among those that have been scored and both have a score of 2, making them potentially closer to a correct sorting. I will aggregate these two nodes to attempt to form a correctly sorted larger list.

Step 40
========================
Action: refine
Nodes: ['6', ' 7']
Explanation: Node 6 and node 7 have the lowest scores, each with a score of 2, indicating they have fewer mistakes compared to other nodes. However, they are still not fully sorted as they do not match the ground truth. To attempt to rectify the remaining errors, we will use the 'refine' operation on these nodes to correct their mistakes.

Step 41
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['6', ' 7']
Explanation: Nodes 6 and 7 have the lowest scores (2 each), indicating they have the fewest sorting mistakes among nodes that have been scored. Thus, they are the closest to being correct. We will proceed by aggregating these two nodes to attempt to create a more complete and correctly sorted list.

Step 43
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['6', ' 7']
Explanation: Nodes 6 and 7 both have scores of 2, which indicates a low number of mistakes in their sorting. To progress towards the solution, we should aggregate these two nodes to combine the sublists they represent into a larger correctly sorted list.

Step 45
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['7', ' 9']
Explanation: Both node 7 and node 9 have sorted lists with a score of 2 indicating only two mistakes. These nodes seem to be the closest to the correct solution. To determine which one is more accurate, it's essential to score these nodes to identify the exact number of mistakes.

Step 49
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['6', ' 7']
Explanation: Node 6 and Node 7 have the lowest scores among nodes that have been scored, indicating fewer mistakes in their sorted lists. To find the best solution, we can perform the 'keepbest' operation to retain the node with the best (lowest) score between them and remove the other.

Step 51
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['5', ' 8']
Explanation: Node 5 and Node 8 are both sorted sublists but Node 5 has a higher score for errors. Let's use the 'keepbest' operation to retain the better sorted list between these two.

Error: list index out of range
===============================
Solving problem 47/100
===============================

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: I will begin by splitting the list in node 0 into two smaller sublists to simplify the sorting problem.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[9, 6, 0, 1, 8, 4, 9, 6, 3, 6, 0, 7, 0, 8, 9, 3, 6, 6, 9, 3, 2, 2, 2, 9, 4, 9, 3, 8, 1, 9, 6, 1]'}

Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Node 1 and Node 2 are sublists split from Node 0, but they are not sorted yet. To move forward with sorting the entire list, let's sort both Node 1 and Node 2 separately.

Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. To make progress towards sorting the entire list, we should merge these sorted sublists.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[9, 6, 0, 1, 8, 4, 9, 6, 3, 6, 0, 7, 0, 8, 9, 3, 6, 6, 9, 3, 2, 2, 2, 9, 4, 9, 3, 8, 1, 9, 6, 1]'}

(4, 5): {}


Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 looks like it might contain the complete sorted list. To verify if it is correctly sorted, we should compare this node with the ground truth.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

Edges:

(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 5): {}
(4, 5): {}


Step 4
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, indicating that their corresponding parent nodes (1 and 2) were correctly split. To move forward, let’s merge these sorted sublists to create a complete sorted list of the original array.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[9, 6, 0, 1, 8, 4, 9, 6, 3, 6, 0, 7, 0, 8, 9, 3, 6, 6, 9, 3, 2, 2, 2, 9, 4, 9, 3, 8, 1, 9, 6, 1]'}

Step 5
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2, respectively. To progress towards the solution, we need to merge these sorted sublists into a single sorted list. 


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[9, 6, 0, 1, 8, 4, 9, 6, 3, 6, 0, 7, 0, 8, 9, 3, 6, 6, 9, 3, 2, 2, 2, 9, 4, 9, 3, 8, 1, 9, 6, 1]'}

(4, 6): {}
(4, 7): {}


Step 6
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists of the original list. By aggregating them, we can potentially form a correctly sorted larger sublist.

Step 13
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['5', ' 6', ' 7', ' 8', ' 9', ' 10']

Step 16
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['11']
Explanation: Node 13 has been scored and does not match the ground truth. We have another node, 11, which has not been scored yet. It's important to score node 11 to understand if it correctly sorts the entire list.

Step 17
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['11', ' 12']
Explanation: Nodes 11 and 12 both scored 1 and contain the same sorted thought. To proceed efficiently, we should keep the best scored node and remove duplicates or less optimal ones.

Step 18
========================
Action: refine

Step 19
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['15']
Explanation: Node 14 has already been scored and has a score of 1, implying one mistake in the sorting. Node 15 is derived from the same original list but hasn't been scored yet. To decide which of these nodes to keep or refine further, scoring node 15 is necessary to compare its correctness.

Step 20
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['14']
Explanation: Node 13 and 15 both represent attempts to merge and sort the entire list but neither matches the ground truth, and they both have scores indicating errors. We will perform a score operation on node 14 to determine the number of mistakes in its sorted list.

Step 21
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['14', ' 15']
Explanation: Both nodes 14 and 15 have been scored with a minimal score of 1, indicating they are nearly sorted except for one mistake. We will use the keepbest operation to retain the node with the highest score, which in this case will be either of them as they have the same score.

Step 23
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['17']
Explanation: Node 16 and Node 17 both result from operations starting with Node 0 and are supposed to represent the entire sorted list. Node 16 has a score of 1, indicating a mistake. Node 17 has not been scored yet but is a direct child of Node 16, so it should be checked for correctness.

Step 31
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['16', ' 17', ' 18', ' 19', ' 21']
Explanation: Nodes 16, 17, 18, 19, and 21 are all derived from node 16 and contain various scores. We need to keep the best sorted sublist from these to make further decisions.

Solving problem 48/100
===============================

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is unsorted and contains all the elements. The first step towards solving the problem is to break down this list into smaller sublists that can be managed more easily.

Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 are sublists derived from the original list in node 0. Before proceeding to further operations such as aggregation or refining, we need to sort each of these sublists individually.

Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists derived from the original list in node 0. To continue towards the solution, the next logical step is to merge these two sorted sublists into a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[7, 3, 4, 8, 4, 2, 8, 3, 1, 0, 7, 3, 1, 9, 1, 8, 0, 1, 9, 8, 3, 2, 4, 1, 7, 3, 1, 3, 2, 0, 4, 0]'}

(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 5): {}
(4, 5): {}


Step 3
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are already sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. We will now aggregate them to form a larger sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[7, 3, 4, 8, 4, 2, 8, 3, 1, 0, 7, 3, 1, 9, 1, 8, 0, 1, 9, 8, 3, 2, 4, 1, 7, 3, 1, 3, 2, 0, 4, 0]'}
1: {'thought': [7, 3, 4, 8, 4, 2, 8, 3, 1, 0, 7, 3, 1, 9, 1, 8], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [0, 1, 9, 8, 3, 2, 4, 1, 7, 3, 1, 3, 2, 0, 4, 0], 'score': None}
3: {'thought': '[0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [7, 3, 4, 8, 4, 2, 8, 3, 1, 0, 7, 3, 1, 9, 1, 8]}
4: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 7, 8, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [0, 1, 9, 8, 3, 2, 4, 1, 7, 3, 1, 3, 2, 0, 4, 0]}

(3, 5): {}
(3, 6): {}
(4, 5): {}
(4, 6): {}


Step 4
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Nodes 5 and 6 both seem to be aggregated sorted lists from the sublists of node 3 and 4 respectively. We need to compare these lists with the ground truth to check if either of them is the correctly sorted list of the entire sequence.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[7, 3, 4, 8, 4, 2, 8, 3, 1, 0, 7, 3, 1, 9, 1, 8, 0, 1, 9, 8, 3, 2, 4, 1, 7, 3, 1, 3, 2, 0, 4, 0]'}

Step 5
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively, and since their combined sorted elements cover the entire original list, it's time to aggregate them into one sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[7, 3, 4, 8, 4, 2, 8, 3, 1, 0, 7, 3, 1, 9, 1, 8, 0, 1, 9, 8, 3, 2, 4, 1, 7, 3, 1, 3, 2, 0, 4, 0]'}

Step 6
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['6', ' 7']
Explanation: Nodes 6 and 7 contain identical sorted sublists derived from the same node. To simplify the graph and reduce redundancy, we will keep the best one, although both are similar.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is unsorted and needs to be broken down into smaller parts to manage the sorting process more effectively.

(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 contain two halves of the original list but are unsorted. To proceed, we need to sort each sublist individually.

Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively, so we will aggregate them to form a larger sorted list.

Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 is the result of aggregating nodes 3 and 4. It appears to be a sorted list but needs to be compared with the ground truth to ensure it is correctly sorted.

Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: The list in node 0 has been split into two sublists: nodes 1 and 2. In order to proceed, we need to sort these individual sublists.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 0, 9, 1, 1, 6, 5, 0, 6, 4, 8, 1, 6, 9, 6, 1, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 5, 8, 3, 2, 2, 9, 8, 4, 6, 6, 9]'}
1: {'thought': [4, 0, 9, 1, 1, 6, 5, 0, 6, 4, 8, 1, 6, 9, 6, 1], 'score': None}

3: {'thought': '[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [4, 0, 9, 1, 1, 6, 5, 0, 6, 4, 8, 1, 6, 9, 6, 1]}
4: {'thought': '[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 5, 8, 3, 2, 2, 9, 8, 4, 6, 6, 9]}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. To proceed, we need to merge these two sorted sublists into a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 0, 9, 1, 1, 6, 5, 0, 6, 4, 8, 1, 6, 9, 6, 1, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 5, 8, 3, 2, 2, 9, 8, 4, 6, 6, 9]'}

Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 appears to be an aggregation of nodes 3 and 4. To confirm if it's the correct solution to our sorting problem, we should compare it to the ground truth.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 0, 9, 1, 1, 6, 5, 0, 6, 4, 8, 1, 6, 9, 6, 1, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 5, 8, 3, 2, 2, 9, 8, 4, 6, 6, 9]'}

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 are sublists derived from the main list in node 0, but neither is sorted. We should sort both sublists to progress towards a solution.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[1, 9, 8, 5, 8, 5, 2, 4, 1, 4, 8, 0, 7, 9, 0, 5, 0, 5, 6, 4, 6, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2, 8, 8, 6, 7, 8, 9]'}

(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to create a single sorted list from the two halves split in nodes 1 and 2.

Step 4
========================

Step 5
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 have already been sorted as sublists, so we will aggregate them to form a larger sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[1, 9, 8, 5, 8, 5, 2, 4, 1, 4, 8, 0, 7, 9, 0, 5, 0, 5, 6, 4, 6, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2, 8, 8, 6, 7, 8, 9]'}

Step 6
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['6']
Explanation: Nodes 6 and 7 seem to be identical and are potential candidates for being the correctly sorted version of the list. We need to compare them with the ground truth to verify if they are indeed the correct solution.

Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 contain sublists from the original list in node 0. We should sort these sublists first before any further operations.

Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate

Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 seems to be an aggregation of nodes 3 and 4 and it contains a fully sorted list of all the elements from the original list in node 0. We should verify if this node matches the ground truth of the sorted list.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 needs to be sorted, but it's too large to handle at once. We should start by splitting it into smaller sublists to make sorting more manageable.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

Step 1
========================
Action: sort

Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are properly sorted sublists of nodes 1 and 2, respectively, which are derived from the original list in node 0. To move towards solving the overall problem, we should now aggregate these two sorted sublists to create a larger sorted list.


Graph state:

(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted versions of the sublists from nodes 1 and 2, respectively. The next logical step is to merge these sorted sublists to form a larger sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 9, 4, 3, 2, 0, 9, 3, 9, 7, 7, 5, 9, 4, 3, 1, 6, 2, 5, 1, 9, 7, 2, 1, 9, 4, 6, 0, 7, 4, 9, 4]'}

5: {'thought': '[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 5): {}
(4, 5): {}


Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 looks like a candidate for the final sorted list as it is the result of aggregating nodes 3 and 4. To ensure it is sorted correctly, we'll compare it with the ground truth.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 9, 4, 3, 2, 0, 9, 3, 9, 7, 7, 5, 9, 4, 3, 1, 6, 2, 5, 1, 9, 7, 2, 1, 9, 4, 6, 0, 7, 4, 9, 4]'}

2: {'thought': [6, 2, 5, 1, 9, 7, 2, 1, 9, 4, 6, 0, 7, 4, 9, 4], 'score': None}
3: {'thought': '[0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [4, 9, 4, 3, 2, 0, 9, 3, 9, 7, 7, 5, 9, 4, 3, 1]}

========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is unsorted, so the first step is to split it into manageable sublists.

(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 are split components of Node 0 but are unsorted. To begin addressing the problem, sorting each of these sublists independently should be a logical next step.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[2, 3, 6, 7, 2, 2, 1, 6, 4, 0, 0, 9, 1, 6, 9, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 1, 7, 1, 2, 1, 6, 0, 1, 6, 4, 1]'}

(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[2, 3, 6, 7, 2, 2, 1, 6, 4, 0, 0, 9, 1, 6, 9, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 1, 7, 1, 2, 1, 6, 0, 1, 6, 4, 1]'}

Edges:

Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 is the result of aggregating nodes 3 and 4, which are sorted sublists of nodes 1 and 2 respectively. The next step is to verify if node 5 matches the ground truth of the sorted list.

Step 4
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists of the original list, and they seem to be sublists of the original list split at nodes 1 and 2. We will aggregate them to merge these sorted sublists into a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[2, 3, 6, 7, 2, 2, 1, 6, 4, 0, 0, 9, 1, 6, 9, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 1, 7, 1, 2, 1, 6, 0, 1, 6, 4, 1]'}

(4, 6): {}


Step 5
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted sublists derived from the original list, and we should now merge these two sorted sublists into a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[2, 3, 6, 7, 2, 2, 1, 6, 4, 0, 0, 9, 1, 6, 9, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 1, 7, 1, 2, 1, 6, 0, 1, 6, 4, 1]'}

Step 6
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted sublists of nodes 1 and 2, respectively. To proceed towards solving the entire problem, these sorted sublists should be merged (aggregated) into a single sorted list.


Graph state:

Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[2, 3, 6, 7, 2, 2, 1, 6, 4, 0, 0, 9, 1, 6, 9, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 1, 7, 1, 2, 1, 6, 0, 1, 6, 4, 1]'}

Step 7
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['6']
Explanation: Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 represent various attempts to sort sublists derived from the original list in node 0. Node 6 seems to be the most complete sorted list, so we need to verify if it matches the ground truth.

Step 8
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['7']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 8 both contain the same list and neither has been checked against the ground truth. It is necessary to verify whether either of these lists is correctly sorted according to the ground truth.

Step 9
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['5', ' 6', ' 7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8 are all attempts at aggregating the sorted sublists from nodes 3 and 4, but all have been marked as not matching the ground truth or have not been verified yet. To resolve which one is the best, we need to score each one to count the mistakes. This will allow us to identify the most accurate aggregation.

Step 12
========================
Action: aggregate

Step 13
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['6', ' 7', ' 8', ' 9']
Explanation: Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 all have the same sorted thought but different scores. Since node 6 has the lowest score (indicating fewer mistakes), it's prudent to keep this node and discard the others for efficiency.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The current node contains a list that needs sorting. To start addressing this, we should split the list into smaller sublists to make the problem more manageable.

Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 have been split from node 0 but are not sorted yet. We need to sort each of these sublists before we can merge them.

Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate

Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is not sorted and has been split into two sublists in nodes 1 and 2. We should now sort each sublist to proceed with the sorting process.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[0, 9, 8, 9, 1, 3, 8, 0, 5, 7, 8, 5, 3, 4, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 6, 5, 1, 4, 5, 1, 3, 1, 8, 9, 2, 6, 9]'}

Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists and are derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. Therefore, to progress towards the solution for the original list in node 0, I will merge the sorted sublists from nodes 3 and 4.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 is the result of aggregating nodes 3 and 4, and it contains a list which appears to be fully sorted. Let's verify if it matches the ground truth.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is unsorted and needs to be split into smaller sublists to manage the complexity of sorting.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 represent sublists that were split from node 0. We need to sort these sublists to further progress in solving the problem.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 contains a sorted list that is a result of aggregating nodes 3 and 4. To check if node 5 is correctly sorted as per the original unsorted list in node 0, we need to compare it with the ground truth.

Step 4
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['5', ' 6']
Explanation: Nodes 5 and 6 have not been sorted yet, so I will split them further to make the sorting process manageable.

Step 21
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 8 are already sorted sublists and are derived from node 3 and node 4 respectively. They also have a score of 0 indicating no mistakes. We will next aggregate these two sorted sublists to move towards a complete sorted list for the first half of the original list.

Step 22
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['16', ' 17']
Explanation: Nodes 7, 8, 16, and 17 are sublists that have been sorted. Nodes 15, 13, and 14 seem to be duplicates, thus redundant. We can score nodes 16 and 17 to evaluate their sorting accuracy.

Step 26
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: It appears that nodes 7 and 8 are correctly sorted sublists of node 3 and node 4 respectively, and they both have a score of 0, indicating no mistakes. To continue progressing towards a fully sorted list, we should merge these two sublists.

Step 39
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 8 are sorted sublists from nodes 3 and 4, respectively, and have been scored with 0 mistakes. We will aggregate these two nodes to combine their sorted sublists.

Step 40
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['16', ' 17']
Explanation: Nodes 16 and 17 both contain correctly sorted sublists of [9, 2, 8, 8] and [8, 1, 1, 1] respectively, which are parts of the original list. We will now aggregate these two nodes to form a correctly sorted larger sublist.

Step 44
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['16', ' 17']
Explanation: Nodes 16 and 17 have sorted sublists with a score of 0, indicating no mistakes. These nodes are derived from nodes 9 and 10, which are part of the second half of the original list split. We should aggregate nodes 16 and 17 to combine these correctly sorted smaller sublists into a larger sorted sublist.

Step 45
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 8 contain sorted sublists and are scored as 0, meaning no mistakes were found in their sorting. To progress towards a complete solution, these nodes will be aggregated to form a larger sorted segment of the list.

Step 48
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['16', ' 17']
Explanation: Nodes 16 and 17 are sorted sublists with scores of 0, indicating no mistakes, and they span different sections of the original list. Hence, they should be aggregated to form a larger sorted segment.

Step 55
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['16', ' 17']
Explanation: Nodes 16 and 17 contain sorted sublists of 4 elements each, derived from node 9 and node 10 respectively. Both nodes 16 and 17 have a score of 0 which implies they are correctly sorted without mistakes. To proceed further with merging these correct sublists, we will aggregate nodes 16 and 17.

========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 8 have sorted sublists with a score of 0, indicating no errors in the sorting. They are correctly sorted parts of the original list. To move towards a complete solution, we need to aggregate these sorted sublists.

Step 69
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: It appears that node 7 and node 8 are sorted sublists of node 3 and node 4 respectively, with each node having a score of 0, indicating no mistakes. To continue the sorting process, we can aggregate these two sorted sublists to form a larger sorted list.

Step 71
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['16', ' 17']
Explanation: Nodes 16 and 17 represent two correctly sorted sublists that can be merged to form a larger sorted sublist. The scores of both nodes are zero, indicating no mistakes in their sorting. Therefore, we can aggregate them to progress in constructing the complete sorted list.

Step 73
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7, 8, 16, and 17 have been shown to be correctly sorted sublists with a score of 0, indicating no mistakes. To combine these correctly sorted sublists into a larger sorted list, we should aggregate nodes 7 and 8 first.

Step 78
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Node 7 and Node 8 are correctly sorted sublists with a score of 0, indicating no mistakes. They are partial solutions derived from Node 3 and Node 4 respectively. To progress towards a complete solution, I will aggregate these two sublists to form a larger sorted sublist.

Step 85
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['16', ' 17']
Explanation: Nodes 16 and 17 contain the sorted sublists [2, 8, 8, 9] and [1, 1, 1, 8], respectively. With scores of 0, they are correctly sorted. To further progress, we need to merge these two sorted sublists into one.

Action: score
Nodes: ['17']
Explanation: We need to score node 17 to evaluate its sorting as it contains a sublist of the original array that has been sorted but not yet evaluated.

Step 88
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 8 contain sorted sublists [0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6] and [0, 1, 1, 3, 4, 7, 7, 8], respectively, and both have a score of 0 indicating no mistakes. I will aggregate these nodes to combine these two sorted sublists into a larger sorted list.

Step 89
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 8 have both been sorted correctly, as indicated by a score of 0. They are sublists of the original list in node 0. I will aggregate these two nodes to create a larger sorted sublist.

Step 90
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['16', ' 17']
Explanation: Nodes 16 and 17 contain correctly sorted sublists and are part of the original split nodes. Therefore, I will aggregate them to form a larger sorted sublist.

Step 92
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 8 contain sorted sublists that are parts of the original list split in previous iterations. Since they are sorted and have no mistakes (score is 0), they can be aggregated to form a larger sorted sublist.

Step 93
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['16', ' 17']
Explanation: Nodes 16 and 17 have small sorted sublists which are a part of the larger list. Both nodes have a score of 0, indicating no mistakes. To further consolidate the sorted list, we will aggregate these nodes to form a larger sorted segment.

Step 95
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['16', ' 17']
Explanation: Nodes 16 and 17 both contain sorted sublists. Node 16 consists of a sublist [2, 8, 8, 9], and Node 17 consists of a sublist [1, 1, 1, 8]. These two nodes are correctly sorted as indicated by their scores (both having a score of 0). To progress towards the solution, we will aggregate these two nodes to combine these two sorted sublists into a larger sorted sublist.

Step 97
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['16', ' 17']
Explanation: Nodes 16 and 17 have sorted sublists and have been scored with a score of 0, indicating no mistakes. To advance towards the final solution, I will aggregate these two nodes to create a larger sorted sublist.

Step 98
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Before proceeding with further actions, nodes 7 and 8, which are already sorted sublists, should be aggregated. This will help in creating a larger sorted segment that can be merged with others to eventually sort the entire list.

Solving problem 60/100
===============================

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The initial list in node 0 needs to be sorted. First, we should split the list into smaller parts to make the sorting manageable.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 8, 0, 9, 5, 6, 6, 8, 5, 2, 9, 4, 8, 2, 3, 5, 7, 6, 1, 7, 1, 4, 3, 9, 4, 5, 9, 5, 1, 9, 9, 9]'}
1: {'thought': [3, 8, 0, 9, 5, 6, 6, 8, 5, 2, 9, 4, 8, 2, 3, 5], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [7, 6, 1, 7, 1, 4, 3, 9, 4, 5, 9, 5, 1, 9, 9, 9], 'score': None}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 are unsorted sublists split from the main list. We need to further decompose these sublists to handle sorting more efficiently.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 8, 0, 9, 5, 6, 6, 8, 5, 2, 9, 4, 8, 2, 3, 5, 7, 6, 1, 7, 1, 4, 3, 9, 4, 5, 9, 5, 1, 9, 9, 9]'}
1: {'thought': [3, 8, 0, 9, 5, 6, 6, 8, 5, 2, 9, 4, 8, 2, 3, 5], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [7, 6, 1, 7, 1, 4, 3, 9, 4, 5, 9, 5, 1, 9, 9, 9], 'score': None}
3: {'thought': [3, 8, 0, 9, 5, 6, 6, 8], 'score': None}
4: {'thought': [5, 2, 9, 4, 8, 2, 3, 5], 'score': None}
5: {'thought': [7, 6, 1, 7, 1, 4, 3, 9], 'score': None}
6: {'thought': [4, 5, 9, 5, 1, 9, 9, 9], 'score': None}
Edges:

(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(1, 4): {}
(2, 5): {}
(2, 6): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sublists that have been split from node 1. To further process them, each sublist needs to be sorted individually.

7: {'thought': '[0, 3, 5, 6, 6, 8, 8, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [3, 8, 0, 9, 5, 6, 6, 8]}
8: {'thought': '[2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 8, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [5, 2, 9, 4, 8, 2, 3, 5]}

(2, 5): {}
(2, 6): {}
(3, 7): {}
(4, 8): {}


Step 3
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 8 represent sorted sublists derived from nodes 3 and 4 respectively. To continue the sorting process, we can aggregate these two sorted sublists into a larger sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 8, 0, 9, 5, 6, 6, 8, 5, 2, 9, 4, 8, 2, 3, 5, 7, 6, 1, 7, 1, 4, 3, 9, 4, 5, 9, 5, 1, 9, 9, 9]'}
1: {'thought': [3, 8, 0, 9, 5, 6, 6, 8, 5, 2, 9, 4, 8, 2, 3, 5], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [7, 6, 1, 7, 1, 4, 3, 9, 4, 5, 9, 5, 1, 9, 9, 9], 'score': None}
3: {'thought': [3, 8, 0, 9, 5, 6, 6, 8], 'score': None}
4: {'thought': [5, 2, 9, 4, 8, 2, 3, 5], 'score': None}
5: {'thought': [7, 6, 1, 7, 1, 4, 3, 9], 'score': None}
6: {'thought': [4, 5, 9, 5, 1, 9, 9, 9], 'score': None}
7: {'thought': '[0, 3, 5, 6, 6, 8, 8, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [3, 8, 0, 9, 5, 6, 6, 8]}
8: {'thought': '[2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 8, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [5, 2, 9, 4, 8, 2, 3, 5]}
9: {'thought': '[0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': None}
Edges:

(1, 4): {}
(2, 5): {}
(2, 6): {}
(3, 7): {}
(4, 8): {}
(7, 9): {}
(8, 9): {}


Step 4
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 8 represent correctly sorted sublists of the original sublist in node 1. To proceed towards sorting the entire list, we need to aggregate these sorted sublists.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 8, 0, 9, 5, 6, 6, 8, 5, 2, 9, 4, 8, 2, 3, 5, 7, 6, 1, 7, 1, 4, 3, 9, 4, 5, 9, 5, 1, 9, 9, 9]'}
1: {'thought': [3, 8, 0, 9, 5, 6, 6, 8, 5, 2, 9, 4, 8, 2, 3, 5], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [7, 6, 1, 7, 1, 4, 3, 9, 4, 5, 9, 5, 1, 9, 9, 9], 'score': None}
3: {'thought': [3, 8, 0, 9, 5, 6, 6, 8], 'score': None}
4: {'thought': [5, 2, 9, 4, 8, 2, 3, 5], 'score': None}
5: {'thought': [7, 6, 1, 7, 1, 4, 3, 9], 'score': None}
6: {'thought': [4, 5, 9, 5, 1, 9, 9, 9], 'score': None}
7: {'thought': '[0, 3, 5, 6, 6, 8, 8, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [3, 8, 0, 9, 5, 6, 6, 8]}
8: {'thought': '[2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 8, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [5, 2, 9, 4, 8, 2, 3, 5]}
9: {'thought': '[0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': None}
10: {'thought': '[0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': None}
Edges:

(2, 6): {}
(3, 7): {}
(4, 8): {}
(7, 9): {}
(7, 10): {}
(8, 9): {}
(8, 10): {}


Step 5
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['9', ' 10']
Explanation: Nodes 9 and 10 are both sorted and appear to be identical, so we can use the 'keepbest' operation to retain the node with the best score and remove the duplicate.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 needs to be sorted. First, we will split the list to start decomposing the problem and handle smaller sections of the list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 8, 0, 2, 4, 3, 1, 9, 2, 9, 1, 1, 3, 7, 9, 9, 9, 1, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5, 7, 7, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2]'}

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 are sublists of the original list in node 0 and need to be sorted.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 8, 0, 2, 4, 3, 1, 9, 2, 9, 1, 1, 3, 7, 9, 9, 9, 1, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5, 7, 7, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2]'}

Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are derived from the original list in node 0 and are individually sorted sublists. To proceed towards our goal, we need to merge these sorted sublists into a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 8, 0, 2, 4, 3, 1, 9, 2, 9, 1, 1, 3, 7, 9, 9, 9, 1, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5, 7, 7, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2]'}

3: {'thought': '[0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [8, 8, 0, 2, 4, 3, 1, 9, 2, 9, 1, 1, 3, 7, 9, 9]}
4: {'thought': '[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [9, 1, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5, 7, 7, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2]}

Step 3
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Node 3 and Node 4 are sorted sublists created from splitting Node 1 and Node 2 respectively. To further progress, we should aggregate these two sorted sublists to see if they form a correctly sorted list when combined.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 8, 0, 2, 4, 3, 1, 9, 2, 9, 1, 1, 3, 7, 9, 9, 9, 1, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5, 7, 7, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2]'}
1: {'thought': [8, 8, 0, 2, 4, 3, 1, 9, 2, 9, 1, 1, 3, 7, 9, 9], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [9, 1, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5, 7, 7, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2], 'score': None}
3: {'thought': '[0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [8, 8, 0, 2, 4, 3, 1, 9, 2, 9, 1, 1, 3, 7, 9, 9]}
4: {'thought': '[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [9, 1, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5, 7, 7, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2]}
5: {'thought': '[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None}
6: {'thought': '[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None}

(3, 5): {}
(3, 6): {}
(4, 5): {}
(4, 6): {}


Step 4
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted sublists of nodes 1 and 2 respectively, and nodes 5 and 6 are the aggregated results of nodes 3 and 4. We need to verify if either node 5 or node 6 matches the ground truth for the sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 8, 0, 2, 4, 3, 1, 9, 2, 9, 1, 1, 3, 7, 9, 9, 9, 1, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5, 7, 7, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2]'}
1: {'thought': [8, 8, 0, 2, 4, 3, 1, 9, 2, 9, 1, 1, 3, 7, 9, 9], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [9, 1, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5, 7, 7, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2], 'score': None}
3: {'thought': '[0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [8, 8, 0, 2, 4, 3, 1, 9, 2, 9, 1, 1, 3, 7, 9, 9]}
4: {'thought': '[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [9, 1, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5, 7, 7, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2]}
5: {'thought': '[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'matches_ground_truth': False}
6: {'thought': '[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None}

(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 5): {}
(3, 6): {}
(4, 5): {}
(4, 6): {}


Step 5
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['5', ' 6']
Explanation: Node 5 and 6 are both results of aggregating nodes 3 and 4, and they have been marked as not matching the ground truth. To further refine these nodes, we will score both Node 5 and Node 6 to identify the mistakes in sorting.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 8, 0, 2, 4, 3, 1, 9, 2, 9, 1, 1, 3, 7, 9, 9, 9, 1, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5, 7, 7, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2]'}
1: {'thought': [8, 8, 0, 2, 4, 3, 1, 9, 2, 9, 1, 1, 3, 7, 9, 9], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [9, 1, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5, 7, 7, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2], 'score': None}

4: {'thought': '[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [9, 1, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5, 7, 7, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2]}
5: {'thought': '[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': 1, 'matches_ground_truth': False}
6: {'thought': '[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': 2}

(4, 5): {}
(4, 6): {}


Step 6
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to form a larger sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 8, 0, 2, 4, 3, 1, 9, 2, 9, 1, 1, 3, 7, 9, 9, 9, 1, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5, 7, 7, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2]'}
1: {'thought': [8, 8, 0, 2, 4, 3, 1, 9, 2, 9, 1, 1, 3, 7, 9, 9], 'score': None}

Step 7
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 represent the split sublists of the original list in node 0. We need to sort these sublists individually to proceed with further steps.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 8, 0, 2, 4, 3, 1, 9, 2, 9, 1, 1, 3, 7, 9, 9, 9, 1, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5, 7, 7, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2]'}

3: {'thought': '[0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [8, 8, 0, 2, 4, 3, 1, 9, 2, 9, 1, 1, 3, 7, 9, 9]}

6: {'thought': '[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': 2}
7: {'thought': '[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None}

9: {'thought': '[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [9, 1, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5, 7, 7, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2]}

Step 8
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['8', ' 9']
Explanation: Nodes 8 and 9 appear to be sorted versions of sublists derived from node 2. To validate their correctness and possibly use them for further aggregation, we need to score these nodes to identify the number of mistakes in each sorted sublist.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 8, 0, 2, 4, 3, 1, 9, 2, 9, 1, 1, 3, 7, 9, 9, 9, 1, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5, 7, 7, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2]'}

2: {'thought': [9, 1, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5, 7, 7, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2], 'score': None}
3: {'thought': '[0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [8, 8, 0, 2, 4, 3, 1, 9, 2, 9, 1, 1, 3, 7, 9, 9]}

(4, 7): {}


Step 9
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['8', ' 9']
Explanation: Nodes 8 and 9 have been scored with zero mistakes, indicating they are correctly sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. Now, we should merge these correctly sorted sublists to create a larger sorted segment of the original list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

Step 19
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 represent sorted sublists of the divided list in node 0. Since these nodes seem to have sorted sublists correctly, I will aggregate them to form a larger sorted list.

Step 22
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['8', ' 9']
Explanation: Nodes 8 and 9 represent sorted sublists that were derived from the original list split between nodes 1 and 2, and they have scores of 0, meaning they have no mistakes. To proceed towards the combined sorted list, we should aggregate these two nodes.

Step 25
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['8', ' 9']
Explanation: Nodes 8 and 9 have been split from Node 1 and Node 2 respectively and further refined into sorted sublists, each with a score of 0, indicating they have no mistakes. To progress towards solving the entire list, it makes sense to aggregate these two sorted sublists into a larger sorted list.

Step 29
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['8', ' 9']
Explanation: Nodes 8 and 9 have sorted lists derived from the sublists of the original unsorted list in node 0. Each has a score of 0, indicating no mistakes in their respective lists, but they do not match the ground truth. To move closer to a correct full list, let's aggregate these two nodes to attempt forming a larger sorted segment.

Step 30
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['10', ' 11']
Explanation: Nodes 8 and 9 have been sorted and scored, but they do not match the ground truth. However, they have no mistakes according to their scores. This suggests a potential discrepancy in the scoring or the ground truth testing. To further investigate, I will score nodes 10 and 11 which are sorted from node 8 and see if there are any mistakes.

Step 31
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['8', ' 9']
Explanation: Nodes 8 and 9 are scored sublists that have been sorted correctly and contain no mistakes (score of 0). These nodes represent two halves of the original list split in node 0. To proceed towards the solution, we need to combine (aggregate) these two halves into a single sorted list.

Step 33
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['8', ' 9']
Explanation: Nodes 8 and 9 contain sublists sorted from the initial split of node 1 and node 2 respectively. Nodes 8 and 9 are also scored with a score of 0, indicating no mistakes in the sorting process. To continue, we should merge these two correctly sorted sublists.

Step 34
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['5', ' 11']
Explanation: Nodes 5 and 11 have both been sorted and scored, and one of them (node 5) has a score of 1 indicating fewer mistakes compared to node 11 which has a score of 1 as well. To proceed with the most promising candidate for a correct list, I will keep the better of the two.

Step 36
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['8', ' 9']
Explanation: Nodes 8 and 9 are previously sorted sublists and have been scored. Both have a score of 0, indicating no mistakes, but they do not match the ground truth. To proceed with the solving process, I will aggregate nodes 8 and 9 to form a larger sorted list and verify if combining these sublists results in a segment of the correct solution.

Step 39
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['32', ' 33']
Explanation: Node 32 and Node 33 have sorted sublists which have been scored but not yet compared to the ground truth. To determine if either of these lists matches the ground truth, I will perform the 'groundtruth' operation on these nodes.

Step 40
========================
Action: refine
Nodes: ['8', ' 9']
Explanation: Node 8 and Node 9 are sorted sublists derived from the initial split of Node 0, but they have been scored with a zero count of mistakes and do not match the ground truth. To find the correct solution, we need to further investigate and refine the possible issues in these nodes, as they are crucial components derived directly from the initial list.

Step 41
========================
Action: refine
Nodes: ['32']
Explanation: Nodes 32 and 33 are sorted sublists that have been scored, but neither matches the ground truth. They might require refinement to fix mistakes. However, node 32 has the lowest score (1 mistake) among them. Let's refine node 32 to address the existing mistakes.

Step 42
========================
Action: refine
Nodes: ['32', ' 33']
Explanation: Nodes 32 and 33 have already been scored and were found not to match the ground truth, with scores 1 and 2 respectively. To proceed further, it would be prudent to refine these nodes to correct any mistakes in sorting.

Step 43
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['32', ' 33']
Explanation: Nodes 32 and 33 have been scored and their scores indicate the number of mistakes. Node 32 has a lower score (1 mistake) compared to Node 33 (2 mistakes). Therefore, we will keep the better performing node which is Node 32 and discard Node 33.

Step 44
========================
Action: refine
Nodes: ['8', ' 9']
Explanation: Nodes 8 and 9 have been previously sorted and are marked with a score of 0, implying no mistakes in their sorted lists. However, they do not match the ground truth, indicating some discrepancies. To further investigate and correct these discrepancies, I will refine nodes 8 and 9 to adjust any potential errors and bring them closer to the ground truth.

Step 46
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['7']
Explanation: Nodes 8 and 9 have scores of 0 and are marked as not matching the ground truth, indicating they are sorted correctly but are not the complete list. To proceed, I will compare node 7, which appears to be a potential complete sorted list of the original array, to the ground truth to verify its correctness.

Step 47
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['38', ' 39']
Explanation: Nodes 38 and 39 have the highest scores among the nodes that have been scored, each with a score of 2, indicating fewer mistakes compared to other nodes with scores. To proceed, we should aggregate these two nodes to potentially form a more accurate sorted list closer to the final solution.

Step 49
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['38', ' 39']
Explanation: Nodes 38 and 39 both have thoughts that are derived from node 8 and have a relatively lower score of 2, indicating fewer mistakes in their sorted lists. Merging these could potentially create a more accurate and complete sorted list. We will aggregate these two nodes to see if we can progress towards a more accurate sorted list of the entire sequence.

Step 50
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['38', ' 39']
Explanation: Nodes 38 and 39 have the lowest scores among the scored nodes and both have been derived from the same initial sublist (node 8). We will attempt to aggregate these nodes to potentially form a more correct larger sorted list.

Step 53
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['46']
Explanation: Node 46 contains a thought that appears to be a completely sorted list of all the numbers from the original list in node 0. To confirm if this is the correct final solution, we will perform the 'groundtruth' operation to compare it with the ground truth.

Step 55
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['38', ' 39']
Explanation: Nodes 38 and 39 have lower scores indicating fewer mistakes compared to other nodes and potentially represent the most accurately sorted sublists. To ensure that one of them holds the best sorted version of the list, it would be beneficial to keep the best version and discard the other. Thus, we will perform a 'keepbest' operation on these nodes.

Step 57
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are already sorted sublists created from the original list in node 0. These can be merged to form a larger sorted sublist. We will aggregate them to progress towards sorting the entire list.

Step 59
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['8', ' 9']
Explanation: Nodes 8 and 9, which are derived from splitting node 0, have been sorted and have a score of 0, suggesting no mistakes. This indicates that each half of the original list was sorted correctly. Therefore, the next logical step is to merge these correctly sorted sublists to form a larger sorted list that is closer to our final solution.

Step 61
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. It is logical to merge these two sorted sublists to get a larger sorted list which is a step towards solving the main problem from node 0.

Step 65
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['8', ' 9']
Explanation: Nodes 8 and 9 both contain sorted sublists derived from the original list in node 0 and have scores of 0, indicating that they have no mistakes. They are therefore the best candidates to be aggregated to form a larger sorted list.

Step 66
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['8', ' 9']
Explanation: Nodes 8 and 9 have correctly sorted sublists, each derived from Node 0. Since both these sublists have been scored previously and have a score of 0 (indicating no mistakes), aggregating them will likely yield a more complete sorted list of the original list in Node 0.

Step 67
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['8', ' 9']
Explanation: Nodes 8 and 9 have correct scores of 0, meaning no mistakes, and are the sorted forms of two halves of the original list (node 0). They have been marked as not matching the ground truth because they represent parts of the original list. Now, we need to merge these two sorted sublists to potentially form a correctly sorted version of the entire list.

Step 68
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['8', ' 9']
Explanation: Nodes 8 and 9 have correctly sorted sublists with a score of 0, indicating no mistakes. They also have the same length and their original lists align with the first two splits from the initial node 0. Therefore, we will aggregate them to create a larger sorted list.

Step 71
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: The problem requires sorting the list in node 0 in ascending order. Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists derived from node 0. To progress towards solving the problem, the next logical step is to merge these sorted sublists into one. This can be achieved by aggregating nodes 3 and 4, as they are each sorted and cover different parts of the original list in node 0.

Step 72
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['8', ' 9']
Explanation: Nodes 8 and 9 are correctly sorted sublists of the original list split in node 0. Additionally, they contain scores of 0, indicating no mistakes in their sorting. These nodes are prime candidates for aggregation to form a larger sorted list that more closely resembles our final objective. Aggregating these could potentially create a larger correctly sorted segment of the original list.

Step 79
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['8', ' 9']
Explanation: Nodes 8 and 9 contain sorted sublists derived from the original list split in node 0. Both have scored 0 mistakes, indicating that they are correctly sorted based on their respective parts. To move towards a complete solution, we will aggregate these two sorted sublists to form a larger sorted sublist.

Step 81
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['8', ' 9']
Explanation: Nodes 8 and 9 each have a score of 0, indicating no mistakes in their sorted lists, but they do not match the ground truth. To attempt to solve the sorting problem correctly, we will aggregate these two nodes to combine their sorted sublists into a larger sorted list, which will hopefully move closer to the correct solution.

Step 82
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['8', ' 9']
Explanation: Node 8 and Node 9 have the correctly sorted sublists from the original list and have been scored with 0 mistakes. We need to aggregate these sorted sublists to form a larger sorted list that could potentially be closer to the sorted version of the entire original list.

Step 83
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['8', ' 9']
Explanation: Nodes 8 and 9 have been sorted and scored with a score of 0, indicating no mistakes in the sublists. Given that the two sublists are sorted correctly, we should perform an aggregation to combine these two sorted sublists into a larger sorted sublist.

Step 86
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['8', ' 9']
Explanation: Nodes 8 and 9 have the lowest scores (both have a score of 0), indicating they are the closest to being accurate. Let's aggregate these two nodes since they represent the sorted sublists of the two halves of the original list.

Step 88
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['46']
Explanation: Node 46 seems to contain the full list sorted correctly as it has a length of 60 which matches the original list length of 32, and it seems to have the correctly sorted elements. We should validate this by comparing it with the ground truth.

Step 90
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['35', ' 36', ' 40', ' 37']
Explanation: Nodes 35, 36, 40, and 37 have already been scored, revealing inaccuracies in their sorting. To progress towards the solution, we will keep the node among them with the highest score (lowest number of mistakes), which will help us focus on the most promising sorted list.

Error: list index out of range
===============================
Solving problem 62/100
===============================

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: Node 0 contains the unsorted list of numbers. To start solving the problem of sorting the list, we need to break down the list into smaller sublists. We will split node 0 into two sublists to begin.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[5, 0, 7, 6, 2, 6, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 3, 9, 5, 4, 9, 0, 0, 4, 9, 0, 3, 1, 4, 7, 5, 9, 8, 6, 0, 7, 3]'}

Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 are sublists derived from the original list in node 0. We should sort each sublist to proceed with sorting the entire list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[5, 0, 7, 6, 2, 6, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 3, 9, 5, 4, 9, 0, 0, 4, 9, 0, 3, 1, 4, 7, 5, 9, 8, 6, 0, 7, 3]'}
1: {'thought': [5, 0, 7, 6, 2, 6, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 3, 9, 5, 4, 9], 'score': None}

3: {'thought': '[0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [5, 0, 7, 6, 2, 6, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 3, 9, 5, 4, 9]}
4: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [0, 0, 4, 9, 0, 3, 1, 4, 7, 5, 9, 8, 6, 0, 7, 3]}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to form a single list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[5, 0, 7, 6, 2, 6, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 3, 9, 5, 4, 9, 0, 0, 4, 9, 0, 3, 1, 4, 7, 5, 9, 8, 6, 0, 7, 3]'}

2: {'thought': [0, 0, 4, 9, 0, 3, 1, 4, 7, 5, 9, 8, 6, 0, 7, 3], 'score': None}
3: {'thought': '[0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [5, 0, 7, 6, 2, 6, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 3, 9, 5, 4, 9]}
4: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [0, 0, 4, 9, 0, 3, 1, 4, 7, 5, 9, 8, 6, 0, 7, 3]}
5: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 5): {}
(4, 5): {}


Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 is the result of aggregating nodes 3 and 4 and appears to contain all the numbers from the original list in node 0. We should verify if this node matches the ground truth.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[5, 0, 7, 6, 2, 6, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 3, 9, 5, 4, 9, 0, 0, 4, 9, 0, 3, 1, 4, 7, 5, 9, 8, 6, 0, 7, 3]'}
1: {'thought': [5, 0, 7, 6, 2, 6, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 3, 9, 5, 4, 9], 'score': None}

Step 4
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 appear to be correctly sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. To progress towards solving the problem, we should merge these sorted sublists into a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[5, 0, 7, 6, 2, 6, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 3, 9, 5, 4, 9, 0, 0, 4, 9, 0, 3, 1, 4, 7, 5, 9, 8, 6, 0, 7, 3]'}

Step 5
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists that were derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. To continue, we will merge these sorted sublists to create a single sorted list.


Graph state:

Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[5, 0, 7, 6, 2, 6, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 3, 9, 5, 4, 9, 0, 0, 4, 9, 0, 3, 1, 4, 7, 5, 9, 8, 6, 0, 7, 3]'}

Step 6
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['6']
Explanation: Nodes 6 and 7 are both sorted sublists, but we need to check if they correctly match the ground truth. Performing ground truth check on node 6 first.

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: The list in Node 0 is unsorted and has been split into two sublists in Nodes 1 and 2. Let's start by sorting each of these sublists individually.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[0, 0, 4, 5, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 5, 2, 5, 0, 0, 2, 1, 4, 6, 2, 0, 8, 8, 0, 5, 4, 3, 6, 8, 1, 0, 0]'}
1: {'thought': [0, 0, 4, 5, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 5, 2, 5, 0, 0, 2], 'score': None}

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists which were split from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. To progress towards sorting the entire list, we'll combine these sorted sublists.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[0, 0, 4, 5, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 5, 2, 5, 0, 0, 2, 1, 4, 6, 2, 0, 8, 8, 0, 5, 4, 3, 6, 8, 1, 0, 0]'}

(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 5): {}
(4, 5): {}


Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 seems to be an aggregation of nodes 3 and 4, which are sorted versions of nodes 1 and 2 respectively. We will now verify if node 5 matches the ground truth of the sorted list.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is unsorted and needs to be broken down into smaller parts to manage sorting it more efficiently.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 7, 4, 1, 6, 1, 9, 8, 1, 9, 7, 8, 8, 4, 6, 4, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 7, 0, 8, 1, 5, 3, 5, 2, 2, 0, 6]'}

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Node 1 and Node 2 are sublists of Node 0. To progress with sorting the list in Node 0, I will score Node 1 and Node 2 to assess the number of mistakes in each sublist.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 7, 4, 1, 6, 1, 9, 8, 1, 9, 7, 8, 8, 4, 6, 4, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 7, 0, 8, 1, 5, 3, 5, 2, 2, 0, 6]'}

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: refine
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 contains sorted sublists derived from Node 0, but they have high scores which indicate many mistakes. To improve them, we should refine each sublist to correct these mistakes.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 7, 4, 1, 6, 1, 9, 8, 1, 9, 7, 8, 8, 4, 6, 4, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 7, 0, 8, 1, 5, 3, 5, 2, 2, 0, 6]'}

Step 3
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists of the original unsorted list in node 0 and seem to be potential candidates for the correct solution. We should first score these nodes to understand if there are any mistakes in their sorting.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 7, 4, 1, 6, 1, 9, 8, 1, 9, 7, 8, 8, 4, 6, 4, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 7, 0, 8, 1, 5, 3, 5, 2, 2, 0, 6]'}

Step 4
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['4']
Explanation: Node 4 has a sorted list with a score of 0, indicating no mistakes in sorting, and matches the original list from node 0. We should verify if this sorted list matches the ground truth.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is unsorted and needs to be broken down into smaller sublists to manage the sorting process more efficiently. Let's split the list into two smaller sublists.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 3, 7, 3, 2, 5, 7, 1, 4, 7, 0, 7, 1, 2, 5, 9, 6, 9, 5, 5, 0, 3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 0, 5, 5, 0, 1, 8]'}
1: {'thought': [3, 3, 7, 3, 2, 5, 7, 1, 4, 7, 0, 7, 1, 2, 5, 9], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [6, 9, 5, 5, 0, 3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 0, 5, 5, 0, 1, 8], 'score': None}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 contain sublists split from the original list in node 0, but they are unsorted. We will start by sorting both sublists in nodes 1 and 2.

(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 appear to be sorted sublists based on their descriptions, we will aggregate them to potentially form a fully sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 3, 7, 3, 2, 5, 7, 1, 4, 7, 0, 7, 1, 2, 5, 9, 6, 9, 5, 5, 0, 3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 0, 5, 5, 0, 1, 8]'}

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 5): {}
(4, 5): {}


Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 is a merged list from nodes 3 and 4, which were individually sorted sublists. To verify if node 5 contains the correct and fully sorted list of numbers, we need to compare it with the ground truth.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: As the list in node 0 is unsorted and contains multiple elements, the first reasonable step is to split this list into smaller sublists to handle them more easily.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[9, 1, 9, 1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 0, 1, 9, 8, 0, 7, 1, 8, 7, 7, 6, 0, 0, 6, 1, 4, 4, 5, 8, 5, 4, 4, 4, 8]'}
1: {'thought': [9, 1, 9, 1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 0, 1, 9, 8, 0, 7, 1, 8], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [7, 7, 6, 0, 0, 6, 1, 4, 4, 5, 8, 5, 4, 4, 4, 8], 'score': None}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 are sublists of the original list in node 0. To further process them, we first need to sort each sublist to see if they are arranged correctly.

Step 2
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 appear to be sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. To verify their correctness, we will score both sublists.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[9, 1, 9, 1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 0, 1, 9, 8, 0, 7, 1, 8, 7, 7, 6, 0, 0, 6, 1, 4, 4, 5, 8, 5, 4, 4, 4, 8]'}

Step 3
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 5): {}

Step 4
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 is formed from the aggregation of nodes 3 and 4, which are both sorted sublists. To verify if node 5 matches the ground truth, the 'groundtruth' operation should be performed.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: To begin solving the problem of sorting the list of numbers, we must first decompose the problem. Splitting the list in node 0 into two sublists can help us manage smaller sections of the list independently.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[0, 7, 5, 5, 0, 3, 0, 7, 3, 9, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 5, 3, 6, 8, 7, 2, 9, 9, 6, 9, 2, 0, 1, 7, 9, 2, 0]'}
1: {'thought': [0, 7, 5, 5, 0, 3, 0, 7, 3, 9, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 5], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [3, 6, 8, 7, 2, 9, 9, 6, 9, 2, 0, 1, 7, 9, 2, 0], 'score': None}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is unsorted and has been split into two sublists in nodes 1 and 2. To proceed, we should sort each of these sublists individually.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[0, 7, 5, 5, 0, 3, 0, 7, 3, 9, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 5, 3, 6, 8, 7, 2, 9, 9, 6, 9, 2, 0, 1, 7, 9, 2, 0]'}

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to form a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[0, 7, 5, 5, 0, 3, 0, 7, 3, 9, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 5, 3, 6, 8, 7, 2, 9, 9, 6, 9, 2, 0, 1, 7, 9, 2, 0]'}

Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 appears to be an aggregated and sorted list from nodes 3 and 4. To verify if this final aggregation matches the correctly sorted version of the original list in node 0, we need to use the 'groundtruth' operation.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is unsorted, and it needs to be split into smaller sublists to simplify the sorting process.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 8, 2, 5, 9, 6, 7, 1, 3, 9, 0, 9, 7, 0, 0, 3, 2, 2, 4, 0, 3, 6, 5]'}
1: {'thought': [1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 8, 2, 5, 9, 6, 7], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [1, 3, 9, 0, 9, 7, 0, 0, 3, 2, 2, 4, 0, 3, 6, 5], 'score': None}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 are both unsorted sublists derived from the original list in node 0. To proceed towards sorting the list, we should first sort each of these sublists.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 8, 2, 5, 9, 6, 7, 1, 3, 9, 0, 9, 7, 0, 0, 3, 2, 2, 4, 0, 3, 6, 5]'}
1: {'thought': [1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 8, 2, 5, 9, 6, 7], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [1, 3, 9, 0, 9, 7, 0, 0, 3, 2, 2, 4, 0, 3, 6, 5], 'score': None}
3: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 8, 2, 5, 9, 6, 7]}
4: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [1, 3, 9, 0, 9, 7, 0, 0, 3, 2, 2, 4, 0, 3, 6, 5]}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 represent sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. In order to merge these sublists into a single sorted list, which might potentially be the correct sorted version of the original list, we need to aggregate them.

Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 appears to be an aggregation of nodes 3 and 4, which are sorted versions of sublists from node 0. To verify if Node 5 indeed contains the correct sorted list, we need to compare it to the ground truth.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 5): {}
(4, 5): {}


Step 4
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively, and those in turn come from the initial unsorted list in node 0. We will aggregate the sorted lists in nodes 3 and 4 to attempt to form a correctly sorted complete list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 8, 2, 5, 9, 6, 7, 1, 3, 9, 0, 9, 7, 0, 0, 3, 2, 2, 4, 0, 3, 6, 5]'}
1: {'thought': [1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 8, 2, 5, 9, 6, 7], 'score': None}

5: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'matches_ground_truth': False}
6: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None}

Step 5
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists of the initial list in node 0, so I will aggregate these sublists to form a larger sorted sublist.

------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 8, 2, 5, 9, 6, 7, 1, 3, 9, 0, 9, 7, 0, 0, 3, 2, 2, 4, 0, 3, 6, 5]'}

Step 6
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists that were previously split from the original list in node 0. We can now merge these two sublists to create a single, larger sorted list.


Graph state:

Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 8, 2, 5, 9, 6, 7, 1, 3, 9, 0, 9, 7, 0, 0, 3, 2, 2, 4, 0, 3, 6, 5]'}

Step 7
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2, respectively. The next logical step is to merge these two correctly sorted sublists to form a single sorted list that could potentially be a candidate for the correct solution.

Step 8
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['7']
Explanation: Nodes 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9 seem to be aggregated attempts of the sorted sublists from nodes 1 and 2. Node 7, 8, and 9 seem to have the same thought which looks like a potential final sorted list. We will perform a 'groundtruth' operation on one of them to verify if it matches the ground truth.

(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is split into two sublists contained in nodes 1 and 2. To move forward, we should sort these sublists to make them ordered.

Step 4
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to form a longer sorted sublist.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

Step 5
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

Step 6
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['5', ' 6', ' 7']
Explanation: Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 seem to represent sorted sublists with scores of zero for nodes 3 and 4. Nodes 5, 6, and 7 have not been evaluated for accuracy yet. To continue, we need to score nodes 5, 6, and 7 to determine their correctness.

Step 7
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['5', ' 6', ' 7']
Explanation: Nodes 5, 6, and 7 all contain the same sorted list but have been scored with one mistake. To streamline the graph and keep only the necessary nodes, we will use the 'keepbest' operation to retain the node with the highest score among them, which in this case, are all the same.

Step 8
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists derived from the original list in node 0. To proceed towards solving the problem, we need to combine these sorted sublists and create a single sorted list.

Step 9
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['9']
Explanation: Nodes 8 and 9 have the same sorted list but node 8 has been scored with a mistake count of 1, while node 9 has not been scored yet. We should score node 9 to compare their performance.

Step 10
========================
Action: refine

Step 11
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['8', ' 9']
Explanation: Nodes 8 and 9 have the same sorted list but with a score of 1. We need to keep the best version of this sorted list, so we will use the 'keepbest' operation to retain only one of these nodes.

Step 12
========================

Step 14
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 have been sorted correctly and are subparts of the original list. To move closer to solving the problem, these sorted sublists should be merged into a single sorted list.

Step 15
========================

Step 16
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['11', ' 13']
Explanation: Node 11 and Node 13 both have scores indicating a single mistake in the sorted list. To determine which of these two nodes has the optimal sorted list, we will keep the best of the two. This eliminates redundant nodes and helps to focus on refining the most promising results.

Step 17
========================
Action: refine
Nodes: ['14']
Explanation: Node 10 and node 12 are sorted sublists that are derived from the original list in node 0, but node 12 has a score of 2 mistakes. Node 14 has a lower score of 1, indicating fewer mistakes. To find a better solution, we should refine node 14 and score it again to see if the mistakes can be corrected.

Step 30
========================
Action: refine
Nodes: ['12']
Explanation: Node 12 and Node 21 appear to be sorted sublists of the original list but both have a score indicating some errors. To further refine the sorting, we should refine Node 12 to correct any errors in it, as it has a higher score than Node 21 indicating more mistakes.

Step 34
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['21', ' 22']
Explanation: Nodes 21 and 22 both have a score of 1, which indicates they have the same number of mistakes. To decide which node to retain, we should perform the 'keepbest' operation, which will keep the node with the highest score (in this case, the lowest number of mistakes) and remove the others.

Step 35
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['18', ' 23', ' 24', ' 25']
Explanation: Node 25 has the least number of mistakes among nodes 18, 23, 24, and 25. To simplify the thought graph and focus on the best solution, we should keep the best node from these.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 needs to be sorted. First, we should split the list to simplify the sorting process.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 4, 5, 0, 8, 3, 9, 7, 0, 2, 0, 2, 8, 5, 8, 2, 6, 2, 1, 9, 4, 5, 3, 3, 4, 0, 5, 7, 7, 2, 4, 0]'}
1: {'thought': [6, 4, 5, 0, 8, 3, 9, 7, 0, 2, 0, 2, 8, 5, 8, 2], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [6, 2, 1, 9, 4, 5, 3, 3, 4, 0, 5, 7, 7, 2, 4, 0], 'score': None}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Since nodes 1 and 2 are sublists split from node 0, but they have not been sorted or scored yet, the next logical step is to sort both sublists to move towards a solution.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 4, 5, 0, 8, 3, 9, 7, 0, 2, 0, 2, 8, 5, 8, 2, 6, 2, 1, 9, 4, 5, 3, 3, 4, 0, 5, 7, 7, 2, 4, 0]'}

(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 appear to have sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2, respectively. To move forward, it would be prudent to aggregate these sorted sublists into a single sorted list to verify if they collectively form a correctly sorted list of the whole array.


Graph state:

Step 6
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['6', ' 7']
Explanation: Nodes 5, 6, and 7 appear to be attempts to aggregate the sorted lists from nodes 3 and 4. However, node 5 has been marked as not matching the ground truth. We should verify nodes 6 and 7 against the ground truth to confirm correctness.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is unsorted and needs to be broken down to smaller manageable parts. I will split it into two sublists.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[0, 4, 8, 5, 2, 4, 6, 7, 2, 6, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 0, 9, 7, 7, 5, 1, 0, 8, 6, 0, 7, 7, 0, 3, 2, 6]'}

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Node 1 and Node 2 are sublists derived from splitting the original list in Node 0. To proceed with solving the problem, it's necessary to sort each sublist individually before they can be merged and compared to the ground truth.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[0, 4, 8, 5, 2, 4, 6, 7, 2, 6, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 0, 9, 7, 7, 5, 1, 0, 8, 6, 0, 7, 7, 0, 3, 2, 6]'}

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 appear to be sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. To proceed towards solving the problem, I will aggregate these sorted sublists into a single sorted list.


Graph state:

Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 appears to be the result of aggregating the sorted sublists from nodes 3 and 4. It contains a sorted sequence which might be correct, but it needs to be checked against the ground truth to ensure it is the correct solution.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 needs to be sorted, but it is currently unsorted and large. To manage this more effectively, we will split it into smaller sublists.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[5, 1, 7, 2, 4, 5, 0, 2, 7, 2, 2, 9, 7, 0, 5, 8, 5, 2, 2, 1, 2, 6, 9, 7, 8, 8, 4, 5, 1, 8, 2, 8]'}

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is still unsorted and it has been split into two sublists in nodes 1 and 2. To further progress, we should sort each of these sublists individually.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[5, 1, 7, 2, 4, 5, 0, 2, 7, 2, 2, 9, 7, 0, 5, 8, 5, 2, 2, 1, 2, 6, 9, 7, 8, 8, 4, 5, 1, 8, 2, 8]'}

Step 3
========================
Action: aggregate

Step 5
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['5', ' 6']
Explanation: Nodes 5 and 6 are identical and both contain a score of 1, indicating that they are sorted sublists with only one mistake. To simplify the graph and focus on the best solutions, we should keep the best (or in this case, either since they are equivalent) and remove the other.

Step 6
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are already sorted sublists representing the split parts of the original list. To continue towards the solution, we should merge these sorted sublists into a single sorted list.

Step 7
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively, and they seem to be sorted correctly. Thus, we will aggregate them to form a larger sorted list that combines the elements from both sublists.

Step 8
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['8', ' 9']
Explanation: Nodes 7, 8, and 9 all contain sorted lists that are derived from node 3 and 4. To determine which of these is the most accurate, we need to score them to compare their accuracy.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[5, 1, 7, 2, 4, 5, 0, 2, 7, 2, 2, 9, 7, 0, 5, 8, 5, 2, 2, 1, 2, 6, 9, 7, 8, 8, 4, 5, 1, 8, 2, 8]'}

Step 9
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['7', ' 8', ' 9']
Explanation: Nodes 7, 8, and 9 all contain the same sorted sublist and have the same score. To simplify the graph, we will keep the best one and remove the rest.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[5, 1, 7, 2, 4, 5, 0, 2, 7, 2, 2, 9, 7, 0, 5, 8, 5, 2, 2, 1, 2, 6, 9, 7, 8, 8, 4, 5, 1, 8, 2, 8]'}

Step 10
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are already sorted sublists of nodes 1 and 2, respectively. To progress towards solving the problem, we need to aggregate these sorted sublists into a larger sorted list.

Step 11
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['10', ' 11']
Explanation: Node 10 and node 11 appear to be similar and sorted. To verify which of them is more accurate, we should score both nodes to count the number of mistakes in each of them.

Step 12
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['10', ' 11']
Explanation: Nodes 10 and 11 both contain a sorted list with the same thoughts and also have the same score. We can keep the best (or any, since they are equivalent) and remove the redundant one.

(3, 12): {}


Step 13
========================
Action: refine
Nodes: ['12']
Explanation: Node 12 has a sorted list, but it contains one mistake according to its score. We will refine this node to correct any mistakes.

Step 14
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['12']
Explanation: Node 12 has a sorted list, and node 13 contains the original unsorted list along with a score. I will use the groundtruth operation on node 12 to compare its sorted list with the ground truth.

Step 16
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists of the original list, so we should merge these sorted sublists into a single sorted list.

Step 17
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['13']
Explanation: Nodes 12 and 13 have the same sorted list, but node 12 is scored as having 1 mistake and does not match the ground truth, while node 13 has not been scored yet. To verify the correctness of the sorting in node 13, we need to score it.

Step 18
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['13']
Explanation: Node 12 and Node 13 contain the same sorted list but Node 12 is scored and marked as not matching the ground truth while Node 13 is scored but not compared against the ground truth for accuracy. We need to verify if Node 13's list matches the ground truth.

Step 19
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['14', ' 15']
Explanation: Nodes 14 and 15 are sorted sublists derived from nodes 3 and 4 respectively but lack scores. The operation required at this stage is to score these nodes to determine how many mistakes, if any, are present in each sorted sublist.

Step 20
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['12', ' 13', ' 14', ' 15']
Explanation: Nodes 12, 13, 14, and 15 seem to be different attempts to aggregate the sorted sublists from nodes 3 and 4, but all have a score of 1 indicating a mistake. To identify the best out of these similar nodes, I will use the keepbest operation to retain the node with the fewest errors.

Step 21
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['16']
Explanation: Node 16 contains a sorted list that is one element short of the original array from node 0. To verify if node 16 has correctly sorted the list, we should compare it with the ground truth.


Graph state:

Nodes:

Step 22
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2, respectively. To proceed with solving the problem, we need to merge these two sorted sublists into a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[5, 1, 7, 2, 4, 5, 0, 2, 7, 2, 2, 9, 7, 0, 5, 8, 5, 2, 2, 1, 2, 6, 9, 7, 8, 8, 4, 5, 1, 8, 2, 8]'}

(2, 4): {}
(3, 16): {}
(3, 17): {}
(4, 17): {}


Step 23
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['17']
Explanation: Nodes 16 and 17 seem to contain the same sorted sublist derived from nodes 3 and 4 but node 16 has a score indicating mistakes. Since node 17 does not have a score, it is prudent to score it to compare its accuracy against node 16.

Step 3
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 have sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. We will aggregate these two sorted nodes to form a single sorted list as they are the next logical combination in the sorting process.

Step 4
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Nodes 5 and 6 seem to contain the same sorted list, which could potentially match the complete sorted list of the original unsorted list in node 0. To verify this, let's perform the groundtruth operation on node 5 to see if it matches the correct sorted order of the list from node 0.

Step 6
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['7']
Explanation: Nodes 6 and 7 have not been compared to the ground truth yet. Node 7 has one additional element compared to Node 6, and both appear to be sorted lists. We will verify Node 7 against the ground truth to check if it is the correct solution.

Step 7
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 represent two halves of the original list in node 0 and have been sorted independently. To move towards a complete solution for the problem, we will merge these two sorted sublists into one.

Step 8
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['6', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 6 and 8 both appear to be sorted lists derived from the original list in node 0, and they have a similar structure. To progress towards solving the problem, let's first compare these nodes with the ground truth to ensure they are correctly sorted in accordance with the problem's requirement.

Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 represent two halves of the original unsorted list contained in node 0. To proceed further, both sublists need to be sorted.

Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2, respectively. We can now merge these two sorted sublists to form a single sorted list, which might be the correct solution for the initial list.

Step 5
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them.

Step 6
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['6', ' 7']
Explanation: Nodes 5, 6, and 7 seem to be attempts to merge the sorted sublists from nodes 3 and 4, but node 5 does not match the ground truth. To determine which of nodes 6 and 7 is correct, we need to score them to identify the one with the least mistakes.


Graph state:

Step 7
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['6', ' 7']
Explanation: Nodes 6 and 7 have been scored and have the same score. Since only one of them is needed for further operations, we will keep the best, which in this case can be either of them as they have the same score.

Step 8
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted sublists of the original list contained in node 0, so we will merge them to form a more complete sorted list.


Graph state:

Step 9
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 represent sorted sublists, and combining them should provide a correctly sorted complete list. The next step is to aggregate these sorted sublists into a merged sorted list.


Graph state:

Step 10
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 have been sorted correctly based on their respective sublists. To progress towards solving the entire problem, we need to merge these sorted sublists into a single sorted list. Therefore, the next operation will be to aggregate them.

Step 13
========================
Action: score

Step 16
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['14']
Explanation: We need to find the correctly sorted list that matches the ground truth from the available options. Node 14 has a thought that matches the expected sorted order of the original list in node 0 but needs to be verified against the ground truth.

Step 17
========================
Action: groundtruth

Explanation: Node 5 has a sorted list but does not match the ground truth, while Node 13 has a score of 3 suggesting mistakes. We have multiple nodes with a score of 2, and since lower scores indicate fewer mistakes, these are better candidates. We will refine nodes 14, 17, and 18 to fix mistakes, given that they have fewer mistakes compared to other nodes.

Step 27
========================
Action: score

Step 28
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['17', ' 18', ' 20']
Explanation: Nodes 17 and 20 have the same sorted list with the same score, and node 18 also has the same list with the same score. To simplify the graph, we should keep the best-scoring node among these similar nodes. Since they all have a score of 2, we will keep just one of them and remove the rest.

Step 29
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['13', ' 14']
Explanation: Nodes 13 and 14 have scores, indicating that they have fewer mistakes than the rest. To determine which one is closer to the correct solution, let's use the 'keepbest' operation to retain the node with the lower score, which represents fewer mistakes.

Error: list index out of range
===============================
Solving problem 75/100
===============================

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: Node 0 contains a list of numbers that need to be sorted. To solve this problem, the first step is to split the list into smaller sublists that can be more manageable.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[7, 1, 9, 4, 7, 4, 0, 5, 0, 7, 2, 0, 8, 5, 8, 4, 2, 2, 5, 9, 2, 3, 8, 2, 7, 4, 6, 6, 8, 6, 3, 3]'}

(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 are sublists split from the original list in node 0. To progress, we need to sort these sublists first.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, stemming from the original list split into two parts in nodes 1 and 2. I will aggregate nodes 3 and 4 to attempt creating a fully sorted list.


Graph state:

Step 3
========================

(4, 5): {}


Step 4
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to form a complete sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[7, 1, 9, 4, 7, 4, 0, 5, 0, 7, 2, 0, 8, 5, 8, 4, 2, 2, 5, 9, 2, 3, 8, 2, 7, 4, 6, 6, 8, 6, 3, 3]'}
1: {'thought': [7, 1, 9, 4, 7, 4, 0, 5, 0, 7, 2, 0, 8, 5, 8, 4], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [2, 2, 5, 9, 2, 3, 8, 2, 7, 4, 6, 6, 8, 6, 3, 3], 'score': None}

5: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'matches_ground_truth': False}
6: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': None}

(3, 5): {}
(3, 6): {}
(4, 5): {}
(4, 6): {}


Step 5
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['6']
Explanation: Node 6 is sorted but it's not sure whether it matches the ground truth. Node 5 is marked as not matching the ground truth. Let's compare node 6 with the ground truth.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[7, 1, 9, 4, 7, 4, 0, 5, 0, 7, 2, 0, 8, 5, 8, 4, 2, 2, 5, 9, 2, 3, 8, 2, 7, 4, 6, 6, 8, 6, 3, 3]'}

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: Node 0 contains a list of numbers that need to be sorted. First, we should split the list into smaller sublists to simplify the sorting process.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[7, 3, 1, 7, 2, 0, 4, 5, 6, 5, 8, 3, 2, 8, 8, 2, 2, 5, 3, 9, 1, 3, 4, 9, 2, 7, 7, 3, 6, 8, 3, 7]'}

2: {'thought': [2, 5, 3, 9, 1, 3, 4, 9, 2, 7, 7, 3, 6, 8, 3, 7], 'score': None}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 contain two halves of the original list in node 0. To proceed, it's beneficial to sort each sublist to simplify the merging process later.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[7, 3, 1, 7, 2, 0, 4, 5, 6, 5, 8, 3, 2, 8, 8, 2, 2, 5, 3, 9, 1, 3, 4, 9, 2, 7, 7, 3, 6, 8, 3, 7]'}

Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[7, 3, 1, 7, 2, 0, 4, 5, 6, 5, 8, 3, 2, 8, 8, 2, 2, 5, 3, 9, 1, 3, 4, 9, 2, 7, 7, 3, 6, 8, 3, 7]'}

Step 3
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[7, 3, 1, 7, 2, 0, 4, 5, 6, 5, 8, 3, 2, 8, 8, 2, 2, 5, 3, 9, 1, 3, 4, 9, 2, 7, 7, 3, 6, 8, 3, 7]'}

(4, 6): {}


Step 4
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['5', ' 6']
Explanation: Nodes 5 and 6 contain identical sorted lists derived from nodes 3 and 4. To confirm which one is correct, we need to score them and compare with the listed numbers from node 0 to evaluate any discrepancies.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[7, 3, 1, 7, 2, 0, 4, 5, 6, 5, 8, 3, 2, 8, 8, 2, 2, 5, 3, 9, 1, 3, 4, 9, 2, 7, 7, 3, 6, 8, 3, 7]'}

(4, 5): {}
(4, 6): {}


Step 5
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to potentially form a correctly sorted larger list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[7, 3, 1, 7, 2, 0, 4, 5, 6, 5, 8, 3, 2, 8, 8, 2, 2, 5, 3, 9, 1, 3, 4, 9, 2, 7, 7, 3, 6, 8, 3, 7]'}

6: {'thought': '[0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': 2}
7: {'thought': '[0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': None}

(3, 7): {}
(4, 5): {}
(4, 6): {}
(4, 7): {}


Step 6
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Nodes 5, 6, and 7 are aggregated results of the sorted sublists from nodes 3 and 4. We need to verify if any of these nodes match the ground truth. Since they are aggregated from sorted sublists, there's a high possibility one of them might be correct. We will check node 5 against the ground truth as it has a defined score which indicates it might have been evaluated already.

Step 8
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8 are aggregates of nodes 3 and 4 and are potentially correct solutions to the sorting problem. However, before selecting the best solution, we need to score them to find which has the least mistakes.

Step 9
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['5', ' 6', ' 7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8 all contain the same sorted sublist and have the same score. To simplify the thought graph, we should keep the best node among them and delete the rest.

Step 10
========================
Action: refine
Nodes: ['9']
Explanation: Node 9 needs refinement as it has a score indicating that there are 2 mistakes in sorting. To correct these, we will use the refine operation.

Step 11
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists based on the original lists from nodes 1 and 2 respectively, and they need to be merged into one sorted list to move closer to the solution.

Step 12
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['11']
Explanation: Nodes 9 and 11 both contain sorted sublists derived from node 3, and they are both candidates for the correct solution. We will score node 11 to assess the number of mistakes in comparison to the expected correct sequence.

Step 13
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['9', ' 11']
Explanation: Nodes 9 and 11 both have the same sorted list and a score of 2, indicating they have the same number of mistakes. To determine which node's sorted list is closer to the correct solution, we will keep the node with the best result.

Step 14
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['10']
Explanation: Node 12 has already been sorted and scored with 2 mistakes, and no other nodes are set up for comparison directly. We should first score node 10 to identify if it has fewer mistakes than node 12. If it does, it might be closer to the correct solution.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is unsorted and contains all the elements of our problem. The first logical step towards sorting it is to split this list into smaller sublists that can be more manageably sorted.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[9, 4, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 8, 8, 8, 7, 2, 7, 9, 5, 0, 2, 6, 4, 8, 1, 3, 5, 4, 1, 8, 7, 4, 7, 7, 0, 8]'}

Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 are sublists split from node 0. To proceed, I will sort each of these sublists to begin arranging the elements in ascending order. 


Graph state:

Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2, respectively. To continue the solution, we will merge these two sorted sublists into a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

(3, 5): {}
(4, 5): {}


Step 3
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 have been sorted and they are sublists of the original list in node 0. The next logical step is to merge these sorted sublists to form a larger sorted list. We will aggregate nodes 3 and 4.

========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists which were derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. These nodes 1 and 2 were originally split from node 0. To proceed, we should merge these sorted sublists to move towards a complete sorted list.


Graph state:

Step 3
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 8 have been sorted as indicated by their thought content, which should be scored to determine the number of mistakes before further operations.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[9, 5, 9, 0, 4, 5, 6, 3, 0, 1, 4, 3, 1, 5, 9, 9, 3, 2, 9, 5, 5, 2, 9, 9, 9, 7, 8, 9, 8, 0, 2, 8]'}

(4, 8): {}


Step 4
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['5', ' 6']
Explanation: Nodes 5 and 6 are unsorted and need to be sorted before they can be aggregated or further processed. I will sort these sublists to make further operations feasible.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[9, 5, 9, 0, 4, 5, 6, 3, 0, 1, 4, 3, 1, 5, 9, 9, 3, 2, 9, 5, 5, 2, 9, 9, 9, 7, 8, 9, 8, 0, 2, 8]'}

Step 5
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['9', ' 10']
Explanation: Nodes 9 and 10 are sublists that have been refined but not yet scored. Scoring these nodes will help us understand if further refinement is needed before proceeding with aggregation.

Step 6
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7, 8, 9, and 10 are correctly sorted sublists of their respective original nodes. We will start by merging nodes 7 and 8 since they are sorted sublists derived from node 1.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[9, 5, 9, 0, 4, 5, 6, 3, 0, 1, 4, 3, 1, 5, 9, 9, 3, 2, 9, 5, 5, 2, 9, 9, 9, 7, 8, 9, 8, 0, 2, 8]'}

Step 7
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['9', ' 10']
Explanation: Nodes 9 and 10 are correctly sorted sublists. We can aggregate them to form a larger sorted sublist.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[9, 5, 9, 0, 4, 5, 6, 3, 0, 1, 4, 3, 1, 5, 9, 9, 3, 2, 9, 5, 5, 2, 9, 9, 9, 7, 8, 9, 8, 0, 2, 8]'}

Step 8
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['11', ' 12']
Explanation: Nodes 11 and 12 contain sorted sublists that are parts of the original list. To move towards solving the whole problem, we should aggregate these two sublists.


Graph state:

Step 9
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['11', ' 12']
Explanation: Nodes 11 and 12 contain sorted sublists that are split from nodes 7, 8, 9, and 10. These sorted sublists are ready to be merged to further consolidate the sorted list.

Step 10
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['13', ' 14']
Explanation: Nodes 11 and 12 have been split and their subnodes (13 and 14) have been generated twice, meaning they are likely identical. We can compare these nodes directly to check if they are correct.

Error: '<' not supported between instances of 'NoneType' and 'int'

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: To begin solving the problem, the list in node 0 should be split into smaller sublists to make sorting manageable.

Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Node 0 has been split into two sublists in nodes 1 and 2. Now, each sublist should be sorted individually.

Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. To proceed towards sorting the entire list, we will merge these two sorted sublists into a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 5): {}
(4, 5): {}


Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 seems to contain a completely sorted list of the original numbers in node 0. We should verify if this sorted list matches the ground truth.


Graph state:

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: To begin solving the problem of sorting the list, we need to decompose it into smaller sublists. This will be achieved by splitting the current list in node 0 into two parts.

Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 represent the split sublists of the original list in node 0. To progress towards sorting the entire list, the next step is to individually sort these sublists.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 1, 1, 3, 0, 2, 8, 0, 9, 5, 3, 7, 7, 6, 8, 5, 2, 9, 3, 2, 6, 4, 2, 1, 7, 9, 4, 0, 1, 9, 3, 0]'}

(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists derived from the split in node 0. To proceed towards solving the problem, we will aggregate these two sorted sublists to form a larger sorted list.


Graph state:

Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Node 0 has been split into nodes 1 and 2, each containing a portion of the original list. To proceed, we need to sort the sublists contained in nodes 1 and 2 to make them easier to manage and compare later.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[0, 1, 4, 1, 5, 7, 4, 9, 3, 7, 5, 3, 6, 5, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 7, 5, 3, 5, 4, 6, 2, 1, 4, 1, 3]'}

(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to form one sorted list from two halves.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[0, 1, 4, 1, 5, 7, 4, 9, 3, 7, 5, 3, 6, 5, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 7, 5, 3, 5, 4, 6, 2, 1, 4, 1, 3]'}

Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 appears to be the aggregated result of nodes 3 and 4, which are sorted sublists of nodes 1 and 2 respectively. To verify if node 5 is the correct sorted list of the entire sequence, we will perform the 'groundtruth' operation on node 5.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: Node 0 contains an unsorted list of numbers. To simplify the sorting process, we should first split this list into smaller sublists.


Graph state:

Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 have been split from node 0 but have not been sorted yet. To proceed with finding a solution, we need to sort both sublists in node 1 and node 2.

Solving problem 84/100
===============================

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is unsorted and needs to be sorted. To begin solving this problem, we will start by splitting this list into two sublists to make the sorting task more manageable.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[2, 5, 4, 9, 4, 5, 3, 8, 1, 5, 0, 4, 5, 5, 7, 4, 6, 6, 7, 7, 1, 9, 6, 5, 8, 6, 3, 6, 8, 9, 0, 7]'}
1: {'thought': [2, 5, 4, 9, 4, 5, 3, 8, 1, 5, 0, 4, 5, 5, 7, 4], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [6, 6, 7, 7, 1, 9, 6, 5, 8, 6, 3, 6, 8, 9, 0, 7], 'score': None}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 represent two halves of the initial list contained in node 0. To proceed, we need to further break down these sublists into smaller parts to simplify the sorting process.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[2, 5, 4, 9, 4, 5, 3, 8, 1, 5, 0, 4, 5, 5, 7, 4, 6, 6, 7, 7, 1, 9, 6, 5, 8, 6, 3, 6, 8, 9, 0, 7]'}

Step 3
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 8 represent sorted sublists. We should now verify if these sublists are sorted correctly by scoring each of them to identify any mistakes.

Step 4
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['5', ' 6']
Explanation: Nodes 5 and 6 are still unsorted sublists, so we will attempt to sort them.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is unsorted and has been split into two sublists in nodes 1 and 2. Before we can aggregate them, we need to sort each sublist individually.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[0, 4, 3, 0, 6, 1, 1, 9, 2, 1, 3, 6, 5, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 4, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1]'}
1: {'thought': [0, 4, 3, 0, 6, 1, 1, 9, 2, 1, 3, 6, 5, 1, 2, 3], 'score': None}

(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. The next logical step is to merge these two sorted sublists to form a larger sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------

Step 3
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted sublists of the original list in node 0. To proceed, we will aggregate these two sublists to create a single sorted sublist.

Step 4
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Nodes 5 and 6 have identical sorted lists and need to be compared to the ground truth to check if the entire list is correctly sorted.

------------------------
Nodes:

Step 5
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists derived from the initial split nodes 1 and 2. I will aggregate them to move towards a complete sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[0, 4, 3, 0, 6, 1, 1, 9, 2, 1, 3, 6, 5, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 4, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1]'}

Step 6
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['5', ' 6', ' 7']
Explanation: Nodes 5, 6, and 7 seem to be attempts to aggregate the sorted sublists from nodes 3 and 4. To find the best aggregation, let's score these nodes to see how many mistakes each contains.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[0, 4, 3, 0, 6, 1, 1, 9, 2, 1, 3, 6, 5, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 4, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1]'}
1: {'thought': [0, 4, 3, 0, 6, 1, 1, 9, 2, 1, 3, 6, 5, 1, 2, 3], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 4, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1], 'score': None}
3: {'thought': '[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [0, 4, 3, 0, 6, 1, 1, 9, 2, 1, 3, 6, 5, 1, 2, 3]}

5: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9]', 'score': 2, 'matches_ground_truth': False}
6: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9]', 'score': 2}
7: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9]', 'score': 2}

(4, 5): {}
(4, 6): {}
(4, 7): {}


Step 7
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['5', ' 6', ' 7']
Explanation: Nodes 5, 6, and 7 have already been sorted and scored, and all have the same score. I will perform a 'keepbest' operation to retain the node with the highest score among them and remove the others, even though they all have the same score.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[0, 4, 3, 0, 6, 1, 1, 9, 2, 1, 3, 6, 5, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 4, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1]'}

8: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9]', 'score': 2}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 8): {}


Step 8
========================
Action: refine
Nodes: ['8']
Explanation: Node 8 has a sorted thought but it has a score indicating there are two mistakes. We should refine node 8 to correct these mistakes.

(8, 9): {}


Step 9
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['9']
Explanation: Node 9 is derived from the original unsorted list and it seems to contain all elements, potentially sorted. We should score this node to understand how many mistakes are present, if any.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[0, 4, 3, 0, 6, 1, 1, 9, 2, 1, 3, 6, 5, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 4, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1]'}
1: {'thought': [0, 4, 3, 0, 6, 1, 1, 9, 2, 1, 3, 6, 5, 1, 2, 3], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 4, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1], 'score': None}
3: {'thought': '[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [0, 4, 3, 0, 6, 1, 1, 9, 2, 1, 3, 6, 5, 1, 2, 3]}

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 8): {}
(8, 9): {}


Step 10
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['8', ' 9']
Explanation: Node 8 and 9 both have sorted lists, but with different lengths and scores. To identify the best sorted list, we will compare them using the 'keepbest' operation to retain the node with the highest score.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[0, 4, 3, 0, 6, 1, 1, 9, 2, 1, 3, 6, 5, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 4, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1]'}

10: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9]', 'score': 2}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 10): {}


Step 11
========================
Action: refine
Nodes: ['10']
Explanation: Node 10 appears to contain almost all elements sorted, but it has a score of 2, indicating that there are mistakes. To correct the list, we need to refine it.

Step 12
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['11']
Explanation: Node 11 seems to be a combination of nodes 10 and additional elements, and is likely intended to be the final sorted list. It should be checked for correctness by scoring it to understand how many sorting mistakes it contains, if any.

Step 13
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['10']
Explanation: Nodes 10 and 11 are sorted sublists which are potentially correct. We can check their accuracy by comparing them with the ground truth.

Step 14
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists derived from the original list in node 0. By aggregating these sorted sublists, we aim to combine them into a single sorted list that might closely represent the sorted version of the entire list.

Step 15
========================
Action: refine
Nodes: ['11']
Explanation: Nodes 10 and 11 both have been scored, showing the same score of 2, but neither matches the ground truth. We need to refine one of them to try to correct the mistakes. Since both scores are the same, we can choose any one to refine. We will refine node 11 to see if we can reduce the mistakes.

Step 18
========================
Action: refine

Step 19
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['12']
Explanation: Node 12 and node 14 have identical sorted lists but still have a score of 2, indicating some errors are present. To identify the errors, it is necessary to compare them with the unsorted original list in node 0 or refine them to fix existing mistakes. We can also use the groundtruth operation to check if any node matches the correct sorted order.

Step 26
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are already sorted sublists of nodes 1 and 2 respectively. To progress towards sorting the entire list, we should merge these sorted sublists to see if their combination is sorted correctly.

Step 27
========================
Action: refine
Nodes: ['17']
Explanation: Node 18 and 19 are both aggregated results of the sorted sublists but neither matches the ground truth. Node 17 has a score of 2 indicating some errors. To ensure the accuracy of the final solution, let's refine node 17 to correct any potential mistakes before proceeding further.

Step 28
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['20']
Explanation: Nodes 17 and 20 are sorted sublists derived from node 0, but each has a different count of elements due to potential mistakes in sorting. Node 17 has a score of 2 which implies it contains sorting mistakes. To verify and compare the correctness of these nodes, it would be useful to score node 20 to understand how many sorting mistakes it contains for further comparison.

Step 29
========================
Action: refine
Nodes: ['17']
Explanation: Node 17 and node 20 both contain sorted sublists derived from the original list in node 0. However, they both consist of incorrect elements or counts of elements. Node 18 has already been compared to the ground truth and was found not to match. We need to refine node 17 to correct any mistakes in the sorting before further actions.

Step 32
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['17', ' 18', ' 19', ' 20', ' 21']
Explanation: The nodes 17 and 20 were attempts to merge sorted sublists and refine the sorting. Node 17 has a score of 2 while node 20 has a score of 4, indicating the number of mistakes in sorting. To determine the best merging approach, we should compare the scores of all merges from nodes 17, 18, 19, and 20.

Step 33
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['17', ' 18']
Explanation: Nodes 17 and 18 both have a score and are part of the refining process. Node 18 has a lower score (1 mistake) compared to node 17 (2 mistakes), which suggests node 18 is closer to correctness. To optimize the path towards the ground truth, we will retain node 18 and discard node 17.

Step 38
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['20', ' 21', ' 23', ' 24']
Explanation: To determine the best sorted list among the available nodes, let's keep the node with the least number of mistakes which means the highest score. Nodes 20, 21, 23, and 24 have scores, so we will perform the 'keepbest' operation on them.

Step 39
========================
Action: refine
Nodes: ['25']
Explanation: Node 25 contains a sorted list that is close to what we expect as a full sorted list, except it has a score of 1 indicating one mistake. We need to refine it to fix any existing mistakes.

Step 41
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['25']
Explanation: Node 26 has been marked as not matching the ground truth, and it has a sorted list which seems to be a combination of nodes 3 and 4. To verify the correctness of node 25, we will compare it with the ground truth since the score is close to being correct.

Step 42
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted sublists, derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. These two nodes should be aggregated to form a combined sorted list of their respective sublists.

Step 43
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 both represent sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2, respectively. Comparing their 'thought' lists, they seem to be sorted correctly but separately. The next logical step is to merge these sorted sublists to form a larger sorted list that combines their elements.

Step 46
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['25', ' 26']
Explanation: Nodes 25 and 26 have already been sorted and scored, but neither matches the ground truth. Since node 25 has a lower score and is closer to being correct, we should keep node 25 and eliminate node 26 to reduce complexity and focus on refining node 25.

Explanation: Nodes 27, 28, and 29 appear to be very similar and are candidates from the sorting of sublists from nodes 3 and 4. To determine which one has the least number of mistakes, we need to score these nodes first as they currently have no scores associated with them.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[0, 4, 3, 0, 6, 1, 1, 9, 2, 1, 3, 6, 5, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 4, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1]'}

Step 52
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['29']
Explanation: Node 29 has the highest score of 0, indicating it has the fewest mistakes among the nodes that have been scored. Let's compare Node 29 with the ground truth to check if it contains the correct sorted list.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is unsorted and needs to be divided into smaller sublists to simplify the sorting process.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 6, 0, 6, 5, 1, 7, 7, 0, 8, 0, 4, 6, 0, 8, 5, 0, 1, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0, 9, 4, 5, 5, 3, 0, 1, 9, 0]'}

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 are unsorted sublists derived from node 0. To assess and correct these sublists, I will first sort each sublist.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 6, 0, 6, 5, 1, 7, 7, 0, 8, 0, 4, 6, 0, 8, 5, 0, 1, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0, 9, 4, 5, 5, 3, 0, 1, 9, 0]'}
1: {'thought': [4, 6, 0, 6, 5, 1, 7, 7, 0, 8, 0, 4, 6, 0, 8, 5], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [0, 1, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0, 9, 4, 5, 5, 3, 0, 1, 9, 0], 'score': None}

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists of their respective original lists, so we will aggregate them to form a larger sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 6, 0, 6, 5, 1, 7, 7, 0, 8, 0, 4, 6, 0, 8, 5, 0, 1, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0, 9, 4, 5, 5, 3, 0, 1, 9, 0]'}

Step 3
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to combine into a larger sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 6, 0, 6, 5, 1, 7, 7, 0, 8, 0, 4, 6, 0, 8, 5, 0, 1, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0, 9, 4, 5, 5, 3, 0, 1, 9, 0]'}

4: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 5, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [0, 1, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0, 9, 4, 5, 5, 3, 0, 1, 9, 0]}
5: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': None}
6: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': None}

(3, 5): {}
(3, 6): {}
(4, 5): {}
(4, 6): {}


Step 4
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Nodes 5 and 6 contain the same sorted list; however, we need to confirm if this fully sorted list matches the correct order.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 6, 0, 6, 5, 1, 7, 7, 0, 8, 0, 4, 6, 0, 8, 5, 0, 1, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0, 9, 4, 5, 5, 3, 0, 1, 9, 0]'}

2: {'thought': [0, 1, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0, 9, 4, 5, 5, 3, 0, 1, 9, 0], 'score': None}
3: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8]', 'score': None, 'original': [4, 6, 0, 6, 5, 1, 7, 7, 0, 8, 0, 4, 6, 0, 8, 5]}
4: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 5, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [0, 1, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0, 9, 4, 5, 5, 3, 0, 1, 9, 0]}
5: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'matches_ground_truth': False}
6: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': None}

(3, 5): {}
(3, 6): {}
(4, 5): {}
(4, 6): {}


Step 5
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Since node 5 and node 6 both contain the aggregated results of nodes 3 and 4, we should compare them with the ground truth to see if any of them have successfully sorted the list correctly.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 6, 0, 6, 5, 1, 7, 7, 0, 8, 0, 4, 6, 0, 8, 5, 0, 1, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0, 9, 4, 5, 5, 3, 0, 1, 9, 0]'}
1: {'thought': [4, 6, 0, 6, 5, 1, 7, 7, 0, 8, 0, 4, 6, 0, 8, 5], 'score': None}

5: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'matches_ground_truth': False}
6: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': None}

(3, 5): {}
(3, 6): {}
(4, 5): {}
(4, 6): {}


Step 6
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 and Node 6 both contain sublists that have been sorted and merged from Nodes 3 and 4. They are both candidates for the correct sorted list of the starting problem in Node 0. We need to check if either of these nodes matches the ground truth to confirm if the solution is correct.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 6, 0, 6, 5, 1, 7, 7, 0, 8, 0, 4, 6, 0, 8, 5, 0, 1, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0, 9, 4, 5, 5, 3, 0, 1, 9, 0]'}
1: {'thought': [4, 6, 0, 6, 5, 1, 7, 7, 0, 8, 0, 4, 6, 0, 8, 5], 'score': None}

Step 7
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['6']
Explanation: Nodes 5 and 6 contain the same sorted list but node 5 has been checked against the ground truth and does not match. Therefore, node 6 should also be checked against the ground truth to verify its correctness.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 6, 0, 6, 5, 1, 7, 7, 0, 8, 0, 4, 6, 0, 8, 5, 0, 1, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0, 9, 4, 5, 5, 3, 0, 1, 9, 0]'}

Step 8
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Nodes 5 and 6 seem to contain the same sorted list and might be correct. We need to verify if either matches the ground truth.

Step 9
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists based on their source nodes (1 and 2, respectively). We will aggregate them to form a larger sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 6, 0, 6, 5, 1, 7, 7, 0, 8, 0, 4, 6, 0, 8, 5, 0, 1, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0, 9, 4, 5, 5, 3, 0, 1, 9, 0]'}

6: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'matches_ground_truth': False}

Step 10
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['5', ' 6', ' 7']
Explanation: Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are sorted sublists derived from the original list in node 0. Since node 5, 6, and 7 are duplicates, the next logical step is to keep the best one among them after scoring each to find the one with the least mistakes.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 6, 0, 6, 5, 1, 7, 7, 0, 8, 0, 4, 6, 0, 8, 5, 0, 1, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0, 9, 4, 5, 5, 3, 0, 1, 9, 0]'}

6: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': 1, 'matches_ground_truth': False}
7: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': 1}

(4, 7): {}


Step 11
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted sublists of the initial split. To progress towards the solution, we should merge these sorted sublists to form a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[4, 6, 0, 6, 5, 1, 7, 7, 0, 8, 0, 4, 6, 0, 8, 5, 0, 1, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0, 9, 4, 5, 5, 3, 0, 1, 9, 0]'}

Step 12
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['5', ' 6', ' 7']
Explanation: Nodes 5, 6, and 7 have been sorted and scored but have nearly identical thoughts with a score of 1, indicating a single mistake in each. It's ideal to keep the best one and remove the rest to simplify the graph and focus on refining the best result.


Graph state:

Step 14
========================
Action: score

Step 15
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['8', ' 9']
Explanation: Nodes 8 and 9 both appear to be sorted versions of the original list but have different scores. To identify the best version, we will use the 'keepbest' operation to retain the node with the highest score.

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 are direct sublists of the original list in node 0, but they haven't been sorted or scored yet. Let's start by sorting both sublists to progress towards a solution.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 0, 1, 6, 6, 0, 7, 9, 2, 5, 8, 4, 5, 8, 1, 4, 8, 0, 6, 4, 0, 7, 1, 2, 3, 9, 4, 8, 7, 3, 8, 2]'}
1: {'thought': [6, 0, 1, 6, 6, 0, 7, 9, 2, 5, 8, 4, 5, 8, 1, 4], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [8, 0, 6, 4, 0, 7, 1, 2, 3, 9, 4, 8, 7, 3, 8, 2], 'score': None}
3: {'thought': '[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [6, 0, 1, 6, 6, 0, 7, 9, 2, 5, 8, 4, 5, 8, 1, 4]}
4: {'thought': '[0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [8, 0, 6, 4, 0, 7, 1, 2, 3, 9, 4, 8, 7, 3, 8, 2]}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. To continue solving the problem, we will now aggregate these sorted sublists.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 0, 1, 6, 6, 0, 7, 9, 2, 5, 8, 4, 5, 8, 1, 4, 8, 0, 6, 4, 0, 7, 1, 2, 3, 9, 4, 8, 7, 3, 8, 2]'}
1: {'thought': [6, 0, 1, 6, 6, 0, 7, 9, 2, 5, 8, 4, 5, 8, 1, 4], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [8, 0, 6, 4, 0, 7, 1, 2, 3, 9, 4, 8, 7, 3, 8, 2], 'score': None}
3: {'thought': '[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [6, 0, 1, 6, 6, 0, 7, 9, 2, 5, 8, 4, 5, 8, 1, 4]}
4: {'thought': '[0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [8, 0, 6, 4, 0, 7, 1, 2, 3, 9, 4, 8, 7, 3, 8, 2]}
5: {'thought': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9]', 'score': None}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 5): {}
(4, 5): {}


Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 contains the aggregated sorted lists from nodes 3 and 4. We now need to verify if this sorted list matches the ground truth.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 0, 1, 6, 6, 0, 7, 9, 2, 5, 8, 4, 5, 8, 1, 4, 8, 0, 6, 4, 0, 7, 1, 2, 3, 9, 4, 8, 7, 3, 8, 2]'}

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 has multiple numbers and is unsorted. To simplify the sorting process, it is beneficial to first split the list into smaller sublists.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[5, 1, 5, 3, 7, 6, 5, 0, 8, 6, 6, 4, 6, 7, 2, 0, 1, 9, 5, 2, 4, 1, 3, 0, 4, 6, 7, 8, 0, 7, 2, 8]'}

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 are sublists derived from node 0 but they haven't been sorted yet. We'll sort both sublists to prepare them for further operations.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[5, 1, 5, 3, 7, 6, 5, 0, 8, 6, 6, 4, 6, 7, 2, 0, 1, 9, 5, 2, 4, 1, 3, 0, 4, 6, 7, 8, 0, 7, 2, 8]'}

Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them.


Graph state:

Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 appears to be a complete and sorted list combining the entire range of numbers from the original list. To ensure it's correctly sorted as per the problem requirement, we will compare it with the ground truth.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is unsorted and needs to be decomposed into smaller sublists for easier sorting.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is unsorted and too large to sort at once efficiently. It has been split into two sublists in nodes 1 and 2. To progress, we should sort these smaller sublists to simplify further operations.


Graph state:

Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 are sublists of the original list in node 0. To proceed towards sorting the entire list, we need to sort each of these sublists first.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to form a larger sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 9, 8, 7, 3, 9, 7, 0, 4, 0, 9, 4, 3, 7, 5, 1, 9, 5, 6, 6, 6, 3, 6, 3, 2, 8, 6, 8]'}

(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}
(3, 5): {}
(4, 5): {}


Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively, and they were further combined into node 5. To verify if node 5 is the correct solution, we will use the 'groundtruth' operation to compare its sorted list with the ground truth.

Step 4
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are already sorted sublists of nodes 1 and 2 respectively, so we will aggregate them to form a larger sorted sublist.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 9, 8, 7, 3, 9, 7, 0, 4, 0, 9, 4, 3, 7, 5, 1, 9, 5, 6, 6, 6, 3, 6, 3, 2, 8, 6, 8]'}

Step 5
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted sublists of nodes 1 and 2 respectively, which are the results of a split operation on the original node 0. Now, we should aggregate nodes 3 and 4 to merge these sorted sublists into a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

Step 6
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['5', ' 6', ' 7']
Explanation: Node 5, 6, and 7 appear to be aggregations of nodes 3 and 4 but need verification. We will score these nodes to determine if they contain the correctly sorted list.

Step 7
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['5', ' 6', ' 7']
Explanation: Nodes 5, 6, and 7 all contain the same sorted list and they are derived from node 3 and 4. We need to keep the best one among them and discard the others.

Nodes: ['12']
Explanation: Node 12 does not match the ground truth, and it seems it lacks the number 6 from the sorted list present in node 11. To correct this and verify the correct sorting, we will refine node 12 based on the correctly sorted list (node 11), ensuring all elements are accounted for.

Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them.

Step 19
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['14']
Explanation: Node 11 seems to have a sorted list and has been scored with a single mistake. It is also the result of aggregating nodes 3 and 4. To understand if this list has fewer mistakes than the other aggregated result in node 12, we should score node 14 as well, which is the result of the same aggregation process but without the scoring process.

Step 20
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['11', ' 14']
Explanation: Nodes 11 and 14 both have a score of 1, meaning they have the same number of mistakes. We should compare these nodes to keep the one with the correct sorted list.

Step 21
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2, which in turn are sublists of the original node 0. To progress towards solving the entire list, the next logical step is to aggregate these sorted sublists into a single sorted list.

Step 45
========================
Action: refine
Nodes: ['26']
Explanation: Node 12 is the result of merging nodes 3 and 4, but it doesn't match the ground truth. Node 26, derived from node 3, has a few sorting errors, indicated by a score of 1 and a mismatch with the ground truth. Node 30, also derived from node 26, has a score of 3, indicating more sorting errors. To find the most accurate sorted list, we need to refine the list with the lowest number of errors. Node 26, having the lowest score among scored nodes, will be selected for refining to attempt to fix the mistakes.

Step 51
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['36', ' 37']
Explanation: Node 36 and Node 37 both have the lowest number of mistakes (score of 1) among the nodes and they have almost similar sorted lists. To proceed towards a final solution, it will be beneficial to keep the best result from these two nodes. We will use the 'keepbest' operation to retain the node with the most accurate sorting based on the score.

Step 53
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['27', ' 32']
Explanation: Nodes 27 and 32 have been sorted with a low number of mistakes and both reflect the same original list split. Since they have the same score, aggregating them could potentially lead to a closer match to the ground truth.

Step 54
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['27', ' 32']
Explanation: Nodes 27 and 32 both have a score of 2, indicating a smaller number of mistakes compared to other nodes, and both have the same list structure except for an extra '3' in node 27. To optimize and choose the best among these, let's use the 'keepbest' operation.

Error: list index out of range

Solving problem 91/100
===============================

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 needs to be sorted, but it is too long to sort effectively in one step. To simplify the problem, I will first split the list into two smaller sublists.

Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 are sublists derived from the original list in node 0 but they are not sorted. We should start by sorting these sublists to simplify the problem.

------------------------
Nodes:

Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sublists that are sorted individually. To progress towards solving the overall problem, we will merge these sorted sublists to create a larger sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively, and their aggregation has resulted in node 5. To verify if node 5 matches the ground truth of the sorted list, we will now perform the groundtruth operation on it.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is unsorted and needs to be broken down into smaller sublists to manage the sorting process. Let's start by splitting this list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[6, 5, 3, 4, 8, 2, 5, 9, 1, 3, 9, 6, 7, 4, 4, 7, 9, 7, 2, 2, 2, 8, 5, 8, 6, 3, 8, 5, 0, 8, 9, 1]'}
1: {'thought': [6, 5, 3, 4, 8, 2, 5, 9, 1, 3, 9, 6, 7, 4, 4, 7], 'score': None}

(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 are split sublists from the original list in node 0. To progress towards sorting the entire list, we should start by sorting each of these sublists individually.

Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists of nodes 1 and 2 respectively, which originated from node 0. To move towards solving the entire list, it would be beneficial to aggregate nodes 3 and 4 into a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:

Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 appears to be a merged and sorted list from nodes 3 and 4. To verify if it is accurately sorted and matches the ground truth, we will use the 'groundtruth' operation to compare it against the correct sorted list.

Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 seems to be a combination of nodes 3 and 4, and potentially the full sorted list. We should verify if it matches the ground truth.

Step 1
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Node 0 represents the original list, and it has been split into two sublists, represented by nodes 1 and 2. Before sorting the sublists, it is beneficial to split them further to manage smaller chunks, which can be organized more efficiently.

Action: sort
Nodes: ['3', ' 4', ' 5', ' 6']
Explanation: Since nodes 3, 4, 5, and 6 are all unsorted sublists, we should begin by sorting each of these sublists to progress towards assembling the entire sorted list.

Step 3
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 8 have been sorted individually. We will now aggregate them to form a larger sorted sublist.

Step 5
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['11', ' 12']
Explanation: Nodes 11 and 12 both have the same sorted sublist and need to be compared to ensure their correctness. We will score both nodes to identify the number of mistakes in their sorting.

Step 6
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 8 have been individually sorted correctly and represent the first and second halves of Node 1. To continue solving the problem, I will aggregate these two sorted sublists to form a single sorted list of Node 1.

Step 7
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['11', ' 12']
Explanation: Nodes 11 and 12 both have the same sorted list with a score, but we need to keep only the best between them. Since their scores are equal, we can keep either. I will select node 11 for the keepbest operation.

Step 8
========================
Action: score
Nodes: ['13']
Explanation: Nodes 13 and 14 are partially aggregated sorted lists derived from Node 7. Since Node 14 has a score indicating mistakes and Node 13 does not have a score, I will score Node 13 to evaluate its correctness and decide which node to keep.

Step 9
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 8 are already sorted sublists derived from node 3 and node 4, respectively. To proceed towards sorting the entire list, we should merge these sorted sublists into a larger sorted sublist.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[8, 1, 9, 6, 1, 7, 1, 2, 6, 9, 0, 6, 0, 6, 8, 2, 3, 5, 8, 7, 9, 0, 9, 1, 7, 5, 4, 3, 7, 1, 8, 8]'}

Step 10
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['13', ' 14']
Explanation: Nodes 13 and 14 both have scores, indicating the number of mistakes in their sorted lists. We should use the 'keepbest' operation to retain the node with the higher score, which indicates fewer mistakes, and discard the other.

Step 11
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['9', ' 10']
Explanation: Nodes 9 and 10 are sorted sublists corresponding to the second half of the original list. Let's aggregate them to form a larger sorted sublist.

Solving problem 96/100
===============================

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The list in node 0 is unsorted, so we need to start by splitting it into smaller sublists to manage sorting it more efficiently.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 7, 6, 2, 0, 4, 8, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 2, 4, 1, 4, 7, 4, 0, 8, 4, 9, 5, 0, 0, 6, 8, 3, 2, 1, 2]'}

(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: The list in node 0 has been split into two sublists in nodes 1 and 2. To further break down the sorting task, it would be helpful to split these sublists again to make the sorting more manageable.


Graph state:

Step 2
========================

Step 3
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['5', ' 6']
Explanation: Nodes 5 and 6 are sublists that need to be sorted, so we will perform the sort operation on each.


Graph state:

Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 7, 6, 2, 0, 4, 8, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 2, 4, 1, 4, 7, 4, 0, 8, 4, 9, 5, 0, 0, 6, 8, 3, 2, 1, 2]'}

Step 4
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7, 8, 9, and 10 represent sorted sublists derived from nodes 3, 4, 5, and 6 respectively. To further progress, we should start merging these sorted sublists to eventually form the entire sorted list. We can begin by aggregating nodes 7 and 8.

Step 5
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['7', ' 8']
Explanation: Nodes 7 and 8 are correctly sorted sublists of their respective original sublists. We will now aggregate these two nodes to combine their sorted lists into a larger sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 7, 6, 2, 0, 4, 8, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 2, 4, 1, 4, 7, 4, 0, 8, 4, 9, 5, 0, 0, 6, 8, 3, 2, 1, 2]'}

(8, 11): {}
(8, 12): {}


Step 6
========================
Action: keepbest
Nodes: ['11', ' 12']
Explanation: Nodes 11 and 12 appear to be duplicates, both containing sorted sublists from the aggregation of nodes 7 and 8. To simplify the graph and reduce redundancy, we should use the 'keepbest' operation to retain only one of these nodes.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The given list in node 0 is unsorted and needs to be split into smaller sublists to simplify the sorting process.

Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: Nodes 1 and 2 are sublists derived from the original list in node 0. To proceed towards sorting the entire list, I will first sort these individual sublists.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 1, 2, 8, 6, 7, 0, 2, 3, 1, 6, 7, 9, 3, 1, 9, 7, 4, 5, 5, 0, 7, 8, 3, 3, 1, 4, 4, 2, 1, 1, 5]'}

(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively, so we should aggregate them to form a single sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 1, 2, 8, 6, 7, 0, 2, 3, 1, 6, 7, 9, 3, 1, 9, 7, 4, 5, 5, 0, 7, 8, 3, 3, 1, 4, 4, 2, 1, 1, 5]'}

Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 appears to be a merger of two sorted lists from nodes 3 and 4. To verify its correctness, we will compare node 5 with the ground truth.

Step 4
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 represent sorted sublists from the original list in node 0. We will aggregate these two sorted sublists to potentially create a fully sorted list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 1, 2, 8, 6, 7, 0, 2, 3, 1, 6, 7, 9, 3, 1, 9, 7, 4, 5, 5, 0, 7, 8, 3, 3, 1, 4, 4, 2, 1, 1, 5]'}

Step 5
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2 respectively. By aggregating them, we aim to create a single sorted list that combines their elements.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 1, 2, 8, 6, 7, 0, 2, 3, 1, 6, 7, 9, 3, 1, 9, 7, 4, 5, 5, 0, 7, 8, 3, 3, 1, 4, 4, 2, 1, 1, 5]'}

Step 6
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 show sorted sublists taken from nodes 1 and 2 respectively, and they seem to be correctly sorted based on the range and sequence. We'll aggregate these two nodes to combine them into a single sorted list.

Step 7
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 contain sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2, respectively. To move towards solving the problem, we should aggregate these two sorted sublists into a single sorted list.

Step 8
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted sublists of the original list in node 0. To proceed towards solving the problem, we need to merge these sorted sublists into a single sorted list.

------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 1, 2, 8, 6, 7, 0, 2, 3, 1, 6, 7, 9, 3, 1, 9, 7, 4, 5, 5, 0, 7, 8, 3, 3, 1, 4, 4, 2, 1, 1, 5]'}

Step 9
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Nodes 5 and 6 both seem to be sorted lists of the same length as the original list in node 0. To verify if either of them is the correct sorted list, we need to compare them with the ground truth.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[3, 1, 2, 8, 6, 7, 0, 2, 3, 1, 6, 7, 9, 3, 1, 9, 7, 4, 5, 5, 0, 7, 8, 3, 3, 1, 4, 4, 2, 1, 1, 5]'}

Step 10
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['6']
Explanation: Nodes 6, 8, and 10 seem to be the results of aggregating the sorted sublists from node 3, and they have been scored. Nodes 7 and 9 are duplicates of node 5 which doesn't match the ground truth. Let's compare nodes 6, 8, and 10 with the ground truth to verify if any of them is the correct solution.

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: The current list in node 0 is unsorted, so the first step is to split this list into smaller sublists in order to apply divide and conquer sorting techniques.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[5, 7, 1, 7, 2, 4, 1, 8, 4, 6, 9, 2, 0, 2, 3, 9, 3, 9, 7, 8, 3, 1, 1, 3, 9, 8, 5, 0, 2, 7, 0, 2]'}

Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: To proceed, we need to sort the sublists to further refine and analyze them. Let's sort both sublists in nodes 1 and 2.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[5, 7, 1, 7, 2, 4, 1, 8, 4, 6, 9, 2, 0, 2, 3, 9, 3, 9, 7, 8, 3, 1, 1, 3, 9, 8, 5, 0, 2, 7, 0, 2]'}
1: {'thought': [5, 7, 1, 7, 2, 4, 1, 8, 4, 6, 9, 2, 0, 2, 3, 9], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [3, 9, 7, 8, 3, 1, 1, 3, 9, 8, 5, 0, 2, 7, 0, 2], 'score': None}

(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted sublists derived from the initial split nodes 1 and 2. To proceed towards sorting the entire list, we should aggregate nodes 3 and 4 to combine the sorted sublists into a single list.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[5, 7, 1, 7, 2, 4, 1, 8, 4, 6, 9, 2, 0, 2, 3, 9, 3, 9, 7, 8, 3, 1, 1, 3, 9, 8, 5, 0, 2, 7, 0, 2]'}

Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 appears to be a candidate for the final sorted list as it aggregates the sorted sublists from nodes 3 and 4. To confirm if this is indeed the correctly sorted list, we will use the 'groundtruth' operation.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[5, 7, 1, 7, 2, 4, 1, 8, 4, 6, 9, 2, 0, 2, 3, 9, 3, 9, 7, 8, 3, 1, 1, 3, 9, 8, 5, 0, 2, 7, 0, 2]'}
1: {'thought': [5, 7, 1, 7, 2, 4, 1, 8, 4, 6, 9, 2, 0, 2, 3, 9], 'score': None}

Step 0
========================
Action: split
Nodes: ['0']
Explanation: To begin sorting the list, we first need to decompose the problem by splitting the list into smaller sublists.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[9, 4, 4, 7, 2, 3, 9, 8, 8, 3, 9, 8, 7, 1, 7, 9, 5, 1, 6, 1, 6, 2, 0, 4, 7, 6, 4, 6, 3, 2, 6, 2]'}
1: {'thought': [9, 4, 4, 7, 2, 3, 9, 8, 8, 3, 9, 8, 7, 1, 7, 9], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [5, 1, 6, 1, 6, 2, 0, 4, 7, 6, 4, 6, 3, 2, 6, 2], 'score': None}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}


Step 1
========================
Action: sort
Nodes: ['1', ' 2']
Explanation: The list in node 0 has been split into two sublists contained in nodes 1 and 2. To proceed, we need to sort each sublist individually.


Graph state:
------------------------
Nodes:
0: {'thought': '[9, 4, 4, 7, 2, 3, 9, 8, 8, 3, 9, 8, 7, 1, 7, 9, 5, 1, 6, 1, 6, 2, 0, 4, 7, 6, 4, 6, 3, 2, 6, 2]'}
1: {'thought': [9, 4, 4, 7, 2, 3, 9, 8, 8, 3, 9, 8, 7, 1, 7, 9], 'score': None}
2: {'thought': [5, 1, 6, 1, 6, 2, 0, 4, 7, 6, 4, 6, 3, 2, 6, 2], 'score': None}
3: {'thought': '[1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9]', 'score': None, 'original': [9, 4, 4, 7, 2, 3, 9, 8, 8, 3, 9, 8, 7, 1, 7, 9]}
4: {'thought': '[0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7]', 'score': None, 'original': [5, 1, 6, 1, 6, 2, 0, 4, 7, 6, 4, 6, 3, 2, 6, 2]}
Edges:
(0, 1): {}
(0, 2): {}
(1, 3): {}
(2, 4): {}


Step 2
========================
Action: aggregate
Nodes: ['3', ' 4']
Explanation: Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists, so we will aggregate them to form a complete sorted list.

Step 3
========================
Action: groundtruth
Nodes: ['5']
Explanation: Node 5 is a merged sorted list of nodes 3 and 4. To verify if it is correctly sorted according to the ground truth, we need to perform the 'groundtruth' operation on node 5.
