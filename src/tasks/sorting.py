Step 1: split
Nodes: [0]
Explanation: To solve this problem, we should decompose node 0 into smaller sublists and sort them individually, since sorting smaller sublists is less likely to introduce errors. The strategy will be to decompose into two lists, sort them individually, then score each sorted sublist to identify whether any mistakes were introduced. Once we find successfully sorted sublists, we can start merging them to find the sorted version of node 0. 

Step 2: sort
Nodes: [1, 2]
Explanation: We are continuing the strategy outlined in step 1. Currently, the list in node 0 has been split into two sublists in nodes 1 and 2. The next step is to sort each of these sublists individually. We will start by attempting to sort each sublist once. Next, we will score each sorting attempt to identify any errors. If any errors are found, we may need to perform additional sorting attempts until a correct sorting is achieved.

Step 3: score
Nodes: [3, 4]
Explanation: We are continuing the strategy outlined in step 1. Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted versions of nodes 1 and 2, which are sublists of node 0. The nodes are marked with a score of None, so the next step is to check if the sublists were correctly sorted. If any mistakes are found, we may need to perform additional sorting attempts until a correct sorting is achieved. Otherwise, we can merge nodes 3 and 4 to find the sorted version of node 0.

Step 4: aggregate
Nodes: [3, 4]
Explanation: We are continuing the strategy outlined in step 1. Currently, the list in node 0 has been split into two sublists in nodes 1 and 2. Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted correctly sorted versions of nodes 1 and 2, so we can now aggregate them to find the sorted version of node 0. We will start by performing a single aggregation attempt.If any mistakes are found, we may need to perform additional aggregation attempts until a correct solution is achieved.

OUTPUT:
Analysis: 
A. Action history: The current strategy is to decompose the initial list into two smaller sublists, sort them individually, then merge them to produce a solution to the original problem. In step 1, the list was decomposed into two sublists. In step 2, the sublists were sorted. In step 3, the sorted sublists were scored, showing that both sublists were correctly sorted. In step 4, the correctly sorted sublists were aggregated. 

B. Graph state: The graph currently has 6 nodes and 6 edges. Node 0 has the initial problem. Nodes 1 and 2 represent sublists of the original list, obtained in step 1. Nodes 3 and 4 were obtained in step 2, and they represent attempted sortings of the sublists in nodes 1 and 2. Nodes 3 and 4 both have a score of 0, marked in step 3. Node 5 is the result of aggregating nodes 3 and 4, obtained in step 4. The score of node 5 is None, indicating it has not been scored yet. 

C. Strategy analysis: The strategy so far is partially successful, since the sublists in nodes 1 and 2 were correctly sorted into nodes 3 and 4. However, the strategy is still pending since we don't know yet if the aggregation was successful.

D. Next action options
    1. Directly compare the current aggregation attempt to the ground truth. Scoring is not necessary if the solution is correct, however if it is incorrect we will have no information on the number of mistakes.

    2. Score node 5 to check if the aggregation was successful. If the sorted list in node 5 matches the ground truth, the score will be 0, and we can then call the groundtruth action to finish the problem.

Next action: groundtruth

Explanation: We are continuing the strategy outlined in step 1. Currently, the list in node 0 has been split into two sublists in nodes 1 and 2. Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2, respectively. Their score is 0, meaning their sorting is correct. Node 5 is the result of aggregating nodes 3 and 4. We should compare the sorted list in node 5 with the ground truth to determine if the aggregation was successful. If the sorted list in node 5 matches the ground truth, we have successfully solved the problem. Otherwise, we may need to perform additional aggregation attempts until a correct solution is achieved.

Explanation: To solve this problem, we should decompose the full list into smaller sublists and sort them individually, since sorting smaller sublists is less likely to introduce errors. The strategy will be to decompose into two lists, sort them individually, then score each sorted sublist to identify whether any mistakes were introduced. Once we find successfully sorted sublists, we can start merging them to produce a solution to the final problem.

Explanation:  We are continuing the strategy outlined in step 1. Currently, the list in node 0 has been split into two sublists in nodes 1 and 2. Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2. We can now aggregate them to find the solution to sorting node 0. We will perform 10 aggregation attempts. Each aggregation attempt will be scored to identify any errors, and if any mistakes are found, we may need to perform additional aggregation attempts until a correct solution is achieved.

Step 5: score
Nodes: [3, 4]
Explanation:  We are continuing the strategy outlined in step 1. Node 0 was split into nodes 1 and 2. Nodes 3 and 4 are correctly sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2. They were aggregated in node 5, and we will now check if the aggregation was correct.

Step 6: aggregate
Nodes: [3, 4]
Explanation: The aggregation of nodes 3 and 4 was not performed correctly and the error count is high, so we will perform another 10 attempts. We will score each attempt to identify any errors, and if any mistakes are found, we may need to attempt refining the best aggregation attempts.

B. Graph state: The graph currently has 6 nodes and 6 edges. Node 0 has the initial problem. Nodes 1 and 2 represent sublists of the original list, obtained in step 1. Nodes 3 and 4 were obtained in step 2, and they represent attempted sortings of the sublists in nodes 1 and 2. Nodes 3 and 4 both have a score of 0, marked in step 3. Node 5 is the result of aggregating nodes 3 and 4, obtained in step 4. The score of node 5 is None, indicating it has not been scored yet. 

C. Strategy analysis: The strategy so far is partially successful, since the sublists in nodes 1 and 2 were correctly sorted into nodes 3 and 4. However, the strategy is still pending since we don't know yet if the aggregation was successful.

D. Next action options
    1. Directly compare the current aggregation attempt to the ground truth. Scoring is not necessary if the solution is correct, however if it is incorrect we will have no information on the number of mistakes.

    2. Score node 5 to check if the aggregation was successful. If the sorted list in node 5 matches the ground truth, the score will be 0, and we can then call the groundtruth action to finish the problem.
</analysis>

<next_action>
groundtruth
</next_action>

<nodes>
[5]
</nodes>

<explanation>
We are continuing the strategy outlined in step 1. Currently, the list in node 0 has been split into two sublists in nodes 1 and 2. Nodes 3 and 4 are sorted sublists derived from nodes 1 and 2, respectively. Their score is 0, meaning their sorting is correct. Node 5 is the result of aggregating nodes 3 and 4. We should compare the sorted list in node 5 with the ground truth to determine if the aggregation was successful. If the sorted list in node 5 matches the ground truth, we have successfully solved the problem. Otherwise, we may need to perform additional aggregation attempts until a correct solution is achieved.

Only output the final merged list without any additional text or thoughts!:</Instruction>

<Approach>
To merge the two lists in a merge-sort style approach, follow these steps:
1. Compare the first element of both lists.
2. Append the smaller element to the merged list and move to the next element in the list from which the smaller element came.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until one of the lists is empty.
4. Append the remaining elements of the non-empty list to the merged list.
</Approach>

Merge the following two lists into one sorted list:
1: {input1}
2: {input2}

<Approach>
To sort the list of numbers follow these steps:
1. Split the list of numbers into two to four unsorted sublists, each containing an equal number of elements from the original list (make sure they don't overlap).
2. Sort each of the unsorted sublists.
3. Merge the sorted sublists into a single sorted list using the merging algorithm from merge sort.
