<Approach>
To fix the incorrectly sorted list follow these steps:
1. For each number from 0 to 9, compare the frequency of that number in the incorrectly sorted list to the frequency of that number in the input list.
2. Iterate through the incorrectly sorted list and add or remove numbers as needed to make the frequency of each number in the incorrectly sorted list match the frequency of that number in the input list.
