To fix the incorrectly intersection set follow these steps:
1. Check for each number in the incorrect intersection set, whether it can be found in both input sets. If not, remove that number from the intersection set.
2. Iterate through the second input set and check whether each number is already in the incorrect intersection set and if not, check whether that number can also be found in the first input set. If so, add that number to the intersection set.

cot_prompt = """<Instruction> Find the intersection of two sets of numbers. You can generate any intermediate solutions, but the final output should be the set of numbers that are present in both sets, prefixed with "Output: ". </Instruction>

<Approach>
To find the intersection of the two sets follow these steps:
1. Split the second input set of numbers into two to four subsets, each containing an equal number of elements from the original set (make sure they don't overlap).
2. For each subset find the set of numbers that are present in the subset and the first input set.
3. Merge the resulting sets into a single output set.
</Approach>

<Example>
Input Set 1: [13, 16, 30, 6, 21, 7, 31, 15, 11, 1, 24, 10, 9, 3, 20, 8]
