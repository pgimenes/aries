Instead, it allows you to cut out any segment of the given array, cyclically shift (rotate) it by any offset and insert it back into the same place.\n\nTechnically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions: \n\n  1. You may select arbitrary indices l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) as the boundaries of the segment. \n  2. Then you replace the segment a[l \u2026 r] with it's cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset d. The concept of a cyclic shift can be also explained by following relations: the sequence [1, 4, 1, 3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 1 and the sequence [4, 1, 3, 1] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 2. \n\n\n\nFor example, if a = [1, \\color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then choosing l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 yields a segment a[2 \u2026 4] = [3, 2, 8]. This segment is then shifted by the offset d = 2 to the left, and you get a segment [8, 3, 2] which then takes the place of of the original elements of the segment. In the end you get a = [1, \\color{blue}{8, 3, 2}, 5].\n\nSort the given array a using no more than n cyclic shifts of any of its segments. Note that you don't need to minimize the number of cyclic shifts. Any method that requires n or less cyclic shifts will be accepted.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 50) \u2014 the length of the array. The second line consists of space-separated elements of the array a_i (-10^9 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9). Elements of array a may repeat and don't have to be unique.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t answers to all input test cases. \n\nThe first line of the answer of each test case should contain an integer k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of actions to sort the array. The next k lines should contain descriptions of the actions formatted as \"l r d\" (without quotes) where l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) are the boundaries of the segment being shifted, while d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 r - l) is the offset value. Please remember that only the cyclic shifts to the left are considered so the chosen segment will be shifted by the offset d to the to the left.\n\nNote that you are not required to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed for sorting. Any sorting method where the number of shifts does not exceed n will be accepted.\n\nIf the given array a is already sorted, one of the possible answers is k = 0 and an empty sequence of cyclic shifts.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n2\n2 1\n3\n1 2 1\n4\n2 4 1 3\n5\n2 5 1 4 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1 2 1\n1\n1 3 2\n3\n2 4 1\n2 3 1\n1 3 2\n4\n2 4 2\n1 5 3\n1 2 1\n1 3 1\n\nNote\n\nExplanation of the fourth data set in the example: \n\n  1. The segment a[2 \u2026 4] is selected and is shifted to the left by 2: [2, \\color{blue}{5, 1, 4}, 3] \\longrightarrow [2, \\color{blue}{4, 5, 1}, 3] \n  2.

You should probably think of them as two separate problems.\n\nYou are given an integer array a[1 \u2026 n] = [a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n].\n\nLet us consider an empty [deque](https://tinyurl.com/pfeucbux) (double-ended queue). A deque is a data structure that supports adding elements to both the beginning and the end. So, if there are elements [3, 4, 4] currently in the deque, adding an element 1 to the beginning will produce the sequence [\\color{red}{1}, 3, 4, 4], and adding the same element to the end will produce [3, 4, 4, \\color{red}{1}].\n\nThe elements of the array are sequentially added to the initially empty deque, starting with a_1 and finishing with a_n. Before adding each element to the deque, you may choose whether to add it to the beginning or to the end.\n\nFor example, if we consider an array a = [3, 7, 5, 5], one of the possible sequences of actions looks like this:    1. |  add 3 to the beginning of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [\\color{red}{3}] in it;   \n---|---|---  \n  2. |  add 7 to the end of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [3, \\color{red}{7}] in it;   \n  3. |  add 5 to the end of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [3, 7, \\color{red}{5}] in it;   \n  4. |  add 5 to the beginning of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [\\color{red}{5}, 3, 7, 5] in it;   \n  \nFind the minimal possible number of inversions in the deque after the whole array is processed. \n\nAn inversion in sequence d is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and d_i > d_j. For example, the array d = [5, 3, 7, 5] has exactly two inversions \u2014 (1, 2) and (3, 4), since d_1 = 5 > 3 = d_2 and d_3 = 7 > 5 = d_4.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 array size. The second line of the description contains n space-separated integers a_i (-10^9 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9) \u2014 elements of the array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be a single integer \u2014 the minimal possible number of inversions in the deque after executing the described algorithm.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\n4\n3 7 5 5\n3\n3 2 1\n3\n3 1 2\n4\n-1 2 2 -1\n4\n4 5 1 3\n5\n1 3 1 3 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n0\n1\n0\n1\n2\n\nNote\n\nOne of the ways to get the sequence [5, 3, 7, 5] in the deque, containing only two inversions, from the initial array [3, 7, 5, 5] (the first sample test case) is described in the problem statement. \n\nAlso, in this example, you could get the answer of two inversions by simply putting each element of the original array at the end of the deque.

The elements of this array can be defined as a^{\u2192 d}_i = a_{(i + n - d) mod n}, where (i + n - d) mod n is the remainder of integer division of i + n - d by n. \n\nIt means that the whole array a^{\u2192 d} can be represented as a sequence $$$a^{\u2192 d} = [a_{n - d}, a_{n - d + 1}, \u2026, a_{n - 1}, a_0, a_1, \u2026, a_{n - d - 1}]$$$\n\n  2.

For a given array a, determine whether it will consist of only zeros at the end of the process. If yes, also find the number of steps the process will take before it finishes.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains two integers: n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6) \u2014 array size and d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 n) \u2014 cyclic shift offset. The second line of the description contains n space-separated integers a_i (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 1) \u2014 elements of the array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be a single integer \u2014 the number of steps after which the array will contain only zeros for the first time. If there are still elements equal to 1 in the array after the end of the process, print -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n2 1\n0 1\n3 2\n0 1 0\n5 2\n1 1 0 1 0\n4 2\n0 1 0 1\n1 1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1\n3\n-1\n0\n\nNote\n\nIn the third sample test case the array will change as follows: \n\n  1. At the beginning a = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0], and a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" is equal to $$$[1  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]$$$ \n  2. Now a = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0], then a^{\u2192 2} = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n  3. And finally, when a = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] we get a^{\u2192 2} = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n\nThus, the answer is 3 steps.\n\nIn the fourth sample test case, the array will not change as it shifts by 2 to the right, so each element will be calculated as 0  \\&  0 or 1  \\&  1 thus not changing its value.

Every two-way railway connects two different stations and has a positive integer length d. No two two-way railways connect the same two stations. Besides, it is possible to travel from any station to any other using those railways. Among these n stations, station 1 is the main station. You can get to any station from any other station using only two-way railways.\n\nBecause of the technological limitation, Nitori can only construct one-way railways, whose length can be arbitrary positive integer. Constructing a one-way railway from station u will costs w_u units of resources, no matter where the railway ends. To ease the congestion, Nitori plans that after construction there are at least two shortest paths from station 1 to any other station, and these two shortest paths do not pass the same station except station 1 and the terminal. Besides, Nitori also does not want to change the distance of the shortest path from station 1 to any other station.\n\nDue to various reasons, sometimes the cost of building a new railway will increase uncontrollably. There will be a total of q occurrences of this kind of incident, and the i-th event will add additional amount of x_i to the cost of building a new railway from the station k_i.\n\nTo save resources, before all incidents and after each incident, Nitori wants you to help her calculate the minimal cost of railway construction.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and q (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 3 \u22c5 10^5, 0 \u2264 q \u2264 2\u22c510^5).\n\nThe second line contains n integers w_1,w_2,\u2026,w_n (1 \u2264 w_i \u2264 10^9).\n\nEach of the next m lines contains three integers u, v, d (1 \u2264 u,v \u2264 n, u \u2260 v, 1 \u2264 d \u2264 10^9), denoting a two-way railway connecting station u and station v, with length d.\n\nThe i-th of the next q lines contains two integers k_i,x_i (1 \u2264 k_i \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 x_i \u2264 4 \u00d7 10^8).\n\nOutput\n\nPrint q+1 lines, and the i-th of these lines contains one integer, denoting the minimal cost of railway construction after the i-1-th incident (especially, the 0-th incident means no incident occurred).\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n2 4 1\n3 5 1\n4 5 1\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n9\n\n\nInput\n\n\n8 11 0\n14 4 16 15 1 3 1 14\n4 2 1\n1 2 3\n7 5 4\n2 3 1\n8 6 2\n8 5 5\n5 4 5\n7 6 7\n3 5 5\n1 6 6\n8 1 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n46\n\n\nInput\n\n\n10 16 8\n29 1 75 73 51 69 24 17 1 97\n1 2 18\n2 3 254\n2 4 546\n2 5 789\n5 6 998\n6 7 233\n7 8 433\n1 9 248\n5 10 488\n2 6 1787\n10 8 1176\n3 8 2199\n4 8 1907\n2 10 1277\n4 10 731\n9 10 1047\n1 11\n1 9\n8 8\n1 3\n2 19\n9 5\n9 4\n7 6\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n34\n45\n54\n54\n57\n76\n96\n112\n112\n\nNote\n\nIn the second example, Nitori can build railways as follows: 1 \u2192 2, 1 \u2192 3, 1 \u2192 4, 2 \u2192 8, and the cost is 14 + 14 + 14 + 4 = 46."], "task_id": "1580_E.

Each line contains two integers x_1 and x_2 (1 \u2264 x_1 \u2264 x_2 \u2264 m), representing a query asking whether the subgrid of a containing the columns x_1, x_1 + 1, \u2026, x_2 - 1, x_2 is determinable.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each query, output one line containing \"YES\" if the subgrid specified by the query is determinable and \"NO\" otherwise. The output is case insensitive (so \"yEs\" and \"No\" will also be accepted).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4 5\n..XXX\n...X.\n...X.\n...X.\n5\n1 3\n3 3\n4 5\n5 5\n1 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n\nNote\n\nFor each query of the example, the corresponding subgrid is displayed twice below: first in its input format, then with each cell marked as \"E\" if it is exitable and \"N\" otherwise.\n\nFor the first query: \n    \n    \n      \n    ..X EEN  \n    ...

Omkar, having created all life, knows this permutation, and will allow you to figure it out using some queries.\n\nA query consists of an array a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n of integers between 1 and n. a is not required to be a permutation. Omkar will first compute the pairwise sum of a and p, meaning that he will compute an array s where s_j = p_j + a_j for all j = 1, 2, \u2026, n. Then, he will find the smallest index k such that s_k occurs more than once in s, and answer with k. If there is no such index k, then he will answer with 0.\n\nYou can perform at most 2n queries. Figure out the meaning of life p.\n\nInteraction\n\nStart the interaction by reading single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the length of the permutation p.\n\nYou can then make queries. A query consists of a single line \"? \\enspace a_1 \\enspace a_2 \\enspace \u2026 \\enspace a_n\" (1 \u2264 a_j \u2264 n).\n\nThe answer to each query will be a single integer k as described above (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n).\n\nAfter making a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n  * System.out.flush() in Java;\n  * flush(output) in Pascal;\n  * stdout.flush() in Python;\n  * see documentation for other languages.\n\n\n\nTo output your answer, print a single line \"! \\enspace p_1 \\enspace p_2 \\enspace \u2026 \\enspace p_n\" then terminate.\n\nYou can make at most 2n queries. Outputting the answer does not count as a query.\n\nHack Format\n\nTo hack, first output a line containing n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100), then output another line containing the hidden permutation p_1, p_2, \u2026, p_n of numbers from 1 to n.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n\n2\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n\n? 4 4 2 3 2\n\n? 3 5 1 5 5\n\n? 5 2 4 3 1\n\n! 3 2 1 5 4\n\nNote\n\nIn the sample, the hidden permutation p is [3, 2, 1, 5, 4]. Three queries were made.\n\nThe first query is a = [4, 4, 2, 3, 2]. This yields s = [3 + 4, 2 + 4, 1 + 2, 5 + 3, 4 + 2] = [7, 6, 3, 8, 6]. 6 is the only number that appears more than once, and it appears first at index 2, making the answer to the query 2.\n\nThe second query is a = [3, 5, 1, 5, 5]. This yields s = [3 + 3, 2 + 5, 1 + 1, 5 + 5, 4 + 5] = [6, 7, 2, 10, 9]. There are no numbers that appear more than once here, so the answer to the query is 0.\n\nThe third query is a = [5, 2, 4, 3, 1]. This yields s = [3 + 5, 2 + 2, 1 + 4, 5 + 3, 4 + 1] = [8, 4, 5, 8, 5]. 5 and 8 both occur more than once here. 5 first appears at index 3, while 8 first appears at index 1, and 1 < 3, making the answer to the query 1.\n\nNote that the sample is only meant to provide an example of how the interaction works; it is not guaranteed that the above queries represent a correct strategy with which to determine the answer."], "task_id": "1586_D.

As you take the eccentric little kid around, you notice something interesting about the structure of the city.\n\nLiyue can be represented as a directed graph containing n nodes. Nodes are labeled from 1 to n. There is a directed edge from node a to node b if and only if a < b.\n\nA path between nodes a and b is defined as a sequence of edges such that you can start at a, travel along all of these edges in the corresponding direction, and end at b. The length of a path is defined by the number of edges. A rainbow path of length x is defined as a path in the graph such that there exists at least 2 distinct colors among the set of x edges.\n\nTeucer's favorite number is k. You are curious about the following scenario: If you were to label each edge with a color, what is the minimum number of colors needed to ensure that all paths of length k or longer are rainbow paths?\n\nTeucer wants to surprise his older brother with a map of Liyue. He also wants to know a valid coloring of edges that uses the minimum number of colors. Please help him with this task!\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of input contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 k < n \u2264 1000). \n\nOutput\n\nOn the first line, output c, the minimum colors you need to satisfy the above requirements.\n\nOn the second line, print a valid edge coloring as an array of (n(n-1))/(2) integers ranging from 1 to c. Exactly c distinct colors should exist in the construction. Print the edges in increasing order by the start node first, then by the second node.\n\nFor example, if n=4, the edge colors will correspond to this order of edges: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n1 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n3 2 2 1 2 2 1 3 1 1 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n8 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n3 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n1 2 2 \n\nNote\n\nThe corresponding construction for the first test case looks like this: \n\n<image> It is impossible to satisfy the constraints with less than 2 colors.\n\nThe corresponding construction for the second test case looks like this: \n\n<image> One can show there exists no construction using less than 3 colors."], "task_id": "1586_F.

Otherwise, he time travels to time a_k then immediately completes the task.\n\n  * If Okabe time travels to time a_k, all tasks completed after this time will become incomplete again. That is, for every j, if a_j>a_k, the j-th task will become incomplete, if it was complete (if it was incomplete, nothing will change).\n\n  * Okabe has bad memory, so he can time travel to time a_k only immediately after getting to time b_k and learning that he was supposed to complete the k-th task at time a_k. That is, even if Okabe already had to perform k-th task before, he wouldn't remember it before stumbling on the info about this task at time b_k again.\n\n\n\n\nPlease refer to the notes for an example of time travelling.\n\nThere is a certain set s of tasks such that the first moment that all of the tasks in s are simultaneously completed (regardless of whether any other tasks are currently completed), a funny scene will take place.

All 2n of these times are distinct (so every time from 1 to 2n inclusive appears exactly once in the input).\n\nThe next line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 n) \u2014 the size of the set s of tasks that lead to the funny scene.\n\nThe last line contains t integers s_1, s_2, \u2026, s_t \u2014 (1 \u2264 s_k \u2264 n, the numbers s_1, s_2, \u2026, s_t are distinct) \u2014 the set s of tasks.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput a single integer \u2014 the number of times that Okabe time travels until all tasks in the set s are simultaneously completed, modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n2\n1 4\n2 3\n2\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n\n\nInput\n\n\n2\n1 4\n2 3\n1\n1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n1 2\n1\n1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n6\n10 12\n3 7\n4 6\n2 9\n5 8\n1 11\n3\n2 4 6\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n17\n\n\nInput\n\n\n16\n31 32\n3 26\n17 19\n4 24\n1 28\n15 21\n12 16\n18 29\n20 23\n7 8\n11 14\n9 22\n6 30\n5 10\n25 27\n2 13\n6\n3 8 2 5 12 11\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n138\n\nNote\n\nFor the first sample, all tasks need to be completed in order for the funny scene to occur.\n\nInitially, the time is 0. Nothing happens until time 3, when Okabe realizes that he should have done the 2-nd task at time 2. He then time travels to time 2 and completes the task.\n\nAs the task is done now, he does not time travel again when the time is again 3. However, at time 4, he travels to time 1 to complete the 1-st task.\n\nThis undoes the 2-nd task. This means that the 2-nd task is not currently completed, meaning that the funny scene will not occur at this point even though the 1-st task is currently completed and Okabe had previously completed the 2-nd task.\n\nOnce it is again time 3 he travels back to time 2 once more and does the 2-nd task again.\n\nNow all tasks are complete, with Okabe having time travelled 3 times.\n\nThe second sample has the same tasks for Okabe to complete. However, this time the funny scene only needs the first task to be completed in order to occur.

here:\nOmkar is hosting tours of his country, Omkarland! There are n cities in Omkarland, and, rather curiously, there are exactly n-1 bidirectional roads connecting the cities to each other. It is guaranteed that you can reach any city from any other city through the road network.\n\nEvery city has an enjoyment value e. Each road has a capacity c, denoting the maximum number of vehicles that can be on it, and an associated toll t. However, the toll system in Omkarland has an interesting quirk: if a vehicle travels on multiple roads on a single journey, they pay only the highest toll of any single road on which they traveled. (In other words, they pay max t over all the roads on which they traveled.) If a vehicle traverses no roads, they pay 0 toll.\n\nOmkar has decided to host q tour groups. Each tour group consists of v vehicles starting at city x. (Keep in mind that a tour group with v vehicles can travel only on roads with capacity \u2265 v.) Being the tour organizer, Omkar wants his groups to have as much fun as they possibly can, but also must reimburse his groups for the tolls that they have to pay. Thus, for each tour group, Omkar wants to know two things: first, what is the enjoyment value of the city y with maximum enjoyment value that the tour group can reach from their starting city, and second, how much per vehicle will Omkar have to pay to reimburse the entire group for their trip from x to y? (This trip from x to y will always be on the shortest path from x to y.)\n\nIn the case that there are multiple reachable cities with the maximum enjoyment value, Omkar will let his tour group choose which one they want to go to. Therefore, to prepare for all possible scenarios, he wants to know the amount of money per vehicle that he needs to guarantee that he can reimburse the group regardless of which city they choose.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5), representing the number of cities and the number of groups, respectively.\n\nThe next line contains n integers e_1, e_2, \u2026, e_n (1 \u2264 e_i \u2264 10^9), where e_i represents the enjoyment value for city i.\n\nThe next n-1 lines each contain four integers a, b, c, and t (1 \u2264 a,b \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^9), representing an road between city a and city b with capacity c and toll t.\n\nThe next q lines each contain two integers v and x (1 \u2264 v \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 x \u2264 n), representing the number of vehicles in the tour group and the starting city, respectively.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput q lines.

The parent of a node v is the next vertex on the shortest path from v to the root.\n\nEach question is defined by three integers v, l, and k. To get the answer to the question, you need to perform the following steps: \n\n  * First, write down the sequence of all integers written on the shortest path from the vertex v to the root (including those written in the v and the root). \n  * Count the number of times each integer occurs. Remove all integers with less than l occurrences. \n  * Replace the sequence, removing all duplicates and ordering the elements by the number of occurrences in the original list in increasing order. In case of a tie, you can choose the order of these elements arbitrary. \n  * The answer to the question is the k-th number in the remaining sequence. Note that the answer is not always uniquely determined, because there could be several orderings. Also, it is possible that the length of the sequence on this step is less than k, in this case the answer is -1. \n\n\n\nFor example, if the sequence of integers on the path from v to the root is [2, 2, 1, 7, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4], l = 2 and k = 2, then the answer is 1.\n\nPlease answer all questions about the tree.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

His favorite game is Bubble Strike, fast-paced bubble shooting online game for two players.\n\nEach game is set in one of the N maps, each having different terrain configuration. First phase of each game decides on which map the game will be played. The game system randomly selects three maps and shows them to the players. Each player must pick one of those three maps to be discarded. The game system then randomly selects one of the maps that were not picked by any of the players and starts the game.\n\nJohnny is deeply enthusiastic about the game and wants to spend some time studying maps, thus increasing chances to win games played on those maps. However, he also needs to do his homework, so he does not have time to study all the maps. That is why he asked himself the following question: \"What is the minimum number of maps I have to study, so that the probability to play one of those maps is at least P\"?\n\nCan you help Johnny find the answer for this question? You can assume Johnny's opponents do not know him, and they will randomly pick maps.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers N (3 \u2264 N \u2264 10^{3}) and P (0 \u2264 P \u2264 1) \u2013 total number of maps in the game and probability to play map Johnny has studied.

Bubbles are so tiny that it can be assumed that each bubble is a point (X_i, Y_i). \n\nQ Bubble Cup finalists plan to play with the bubbles. Each finalist would link to use infinitely long Bubble Cup stick to pop some bubbles. The i-th finalist would like to place the stick in the direction of vector (dxi, dyi), and plays the following game until K_i bubbles are popped. The game starts with finalist placing the stick in the direction of vector (dx_i, dy_i), and sweeping it from the infinity to the left until it hits some bubble, which is immediately popped. It is guaranteed that only one bubble will be hit in this step. After that the finalist starts rotating the stick in the counter clockwise direction with the center of rotation in point where the previous bubble was popped. When the next bubble is hit, it is immediately popped and becomes the new center of rotation. The process continues until K_i bubbles have been popped. It is guaranteed that the stick won't hit two bubbles simultaneously in this process. \n\nFor each finalist find which bubble would be popped the last. Note that each game starts with the configuration of all N bubbles, so the games don't depend on the previous games. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer N \u2014 the number of bubbles. (1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5)\n\nEach of the next N lines contains two integers. The i-th line contains integers X_i and Y_i \u2014 the coordinates of the i-th bubble. (-10^9 \u2264 X_i, Y_i \u2264 10^9, (X_i, Y_i) \u2260 (X_j, Y_j) for i \u2260 j)\n\nThe next line contains one integer Q \u2014 the number of finalists willing to play with the bubbles. (1 \u2264 Q \u2264 10^5)\n\nEach of the next Q lines contains 3 integers. The i-th line contains integers dx_i, dy_i and K_i. (-10^9 \u2264 dx_i, dy_i \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 K_i \u2264 N)\n\nOutput\n\nFor each of the Q finalists, print the index of the bubble which would be popped last, in the separate line. \n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n0 0\n1 0\n0 1\n1 1\n2\n1 -1 3\n-1 1 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n4\n2\n\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1\n2 2\n7 1\n1 7\n3\n2 2 1\n1 -5 4\n-6 5 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n2\n3\n\nNote\n\nThere are two finalists willing to play with the bubbles. If the first finalist plays with the bubbles, then the bubbles at coordinates (0, 0), (1, 0) and (1, 1) would be popped in that order. Their indexes are 1, 2 and 4, so the answer is 4. If the second finalist plays with the bubbles, then the bubbles at coordinates (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 0) and (1, 0) would be popped in that order, so the answer is 2.\n\nVisualization: [link](https://petljamediastorage.blob.core.windows.net/uploads/example1.gif).

The manhattan distance from square (a, b) to square (p, q) is calculated as |a\u2212p|+|b\u2212q|. If you try to place the device inside the enemy base, you will be captured by the enemy. Because of this, you need to make sure to never place the device inside the enemy base. \n\nUnfortunately, the device is powered by a battery and you can't recharge it. This means that you can use the device at most 40 times. \n\nInput\n\nThe input contains the answers to your queries. \n\nInteraction\n\nYour code is allowed to place the device on any square in the grid by writing \"? i j\" (1 \u2264 i,j \u2264 10^9). In return, it will recieve the manhattan distance to the closest square of the enemy base from square (i,j) or -1 if the square you placed the device on is inside the enemy base or outside the grid. \n\nIf you recieve -1 instead of a positive number, exit immidiately and you will see the wrong answer verdict. Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nYour solution should use no more than 40 queries. \n\nOnce you are sure where the enemy base is located, you should print \"! x y p q\" (1 \u2264 x \u2264 p\u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 y \u2264 q\u2264 10^9), where (x, y) is the square inside the enemy base with the smallest x and y coordinates, and (p, q) is the square inside the enemy base with the largest x and y coordinates. Note that answering doesn't count as one of the 40 queries.\n\nAfter printing a query or printing the answer, do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use: \n\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; \n  * System.out.flush() in Java; \n  * flush(output) in Pascal; \n  * stdout.flush() in Python; \n  * See the documentation for other languages.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n1\n2\n1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n? 2 2\n? 5 5\n? 4 7\n? 1 5\n! 2 3 4 5"], "task_id": "1599_H.

The array beautifier constructs the new array in the following way: it takes two numbers at different indices from the original array and writes their sum to the end of the new array. It does this step N times - resulting in an output array of length N. During this process, the machine can take the same index multiple times in different steps. \n\nBob was very excited about the gift that his friends gave him, so he put his favorite array in the machine. However, when the machine finished, Bob was not happy with the resulting array. He misses his favorite array very much, and hopes to get it back. \n\nGiven the array that the machine outputted, help Bob find an array that could be the original array that he put in the machine. Sometimes the machine makes mistakes, so it is possible that no appropriate input array exists for the array it has outputted. In such case, let Bob know that his array is forever lost.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one positive integer N (2 \u2264 N \u2264 10^3) \u2013 the length of Bob's array.\n\nThe second line contains N integers B_1, B_2, ..., B_N (1 \u2264 B_i \u2264 10^6) \u2013 the elements of the array the machine outputted.\n\nOutput\n\nIf an appropriate input array exists, print \"YES\", followed by the input array A_1, A_2, ..., A_N (-10^9 \u2264 A_i \u2264 10^9) in the next line.

Unfortunately, after a poor jump, he fell into a well of n meters depth. Now Gorf is on the bottom of the well and has a long way up.\n\nThe surface of the well's walls vary in quality: somewhere they are slippery, but somewhere have convenient ledges. In other words, if Gorf is on x meters below ground level, then in one jump he can go up on any integer distance from 0 to a_x meters inclusive. (Note that Gorf can't jump down, only up).\n\nUnfortunately, Gorf has to take a break after each jump (including jump on 0 meters). And after jumping up to position x meters below ground level, he'll slip exactly b_x meters down while resting.\n\nCalculate the minimum number of jumps Gorf needs to reach ground level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 300 000) \u2014 the depth of the well.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 i), where a_i is the maximum height Gorf can jump from i meters below ground level.\n\nThe third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \u2026, b_n (0 \u2264 b_i \u2264 n - i), where b_i is the distance Gorf will slip down if he takes a break on i meters below ground level.\n\nOutput\n\nIf Gorf can't reach ground level, print -1. Otherwise, firstly print integer k \u2014 the minimum possible number of jumps.\n\nThen print the sequence d_1,\\,d_2, \u2026,\\,d_k where d_j is the depth Gorf'll reach after the j-th jump, but before he'll slip down during the break. Ground level is equal to 0.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n1 0 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n2\n1 1\n1 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n-1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n10\n0 1 2 3 5 5 6 7 8 5\n9 8 7 1 5 4 3 2 0 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n9 4 0 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, Gorf is on the bottom of the well and jump to the height 1 meter below ground level. After that he slip down by meter and stays on height 2 meters below ground level. Now, from here, he can reach ground level in one jump.\n\nIn the second example, Gorf can jump to one meter below ground level, but will slip down back to the bottom of the well. That's why he can't reach ground level.\n\nIn the third example, Gorf can reach ground level only from the height 5 meters below the ground level.

In this game, his character has to kill a dragon. The battle with the dragon lasts 100^{500} seconds, during which Monocarp attacks the dragon with a poisoned dagger. The i-th attack is performed at the beginning of the a_i-th second from the battle start. The dagger itself does not deal damage, but it applies a poison effect on the dragon, which deals 1 damage during each of the next k seconds (starting with the same second when the dragon was stabbed by the dagger). However, if the dragon has already been poisoned, then the dagger updates the poison effect (i.e. cancels the current poison effect and applies a new one).\n\nFor example, suppose k = 4, and Monocarp stabs the dragon during the seconds 2, 4 and 10. Then the poison effect is applied at the start of the 2-nd second and deals 1 damage during the 2-nd and 3-rd seconds; then, at the beginning of the 4-th second, the poison effect is reapplied, so it deals exactly 1 damage during the seconds 4, 5, 6 and 7; then, during the 10-th second, the poison effect is applied again, and it deals 1 damage during the seconds 10, 11, 12 and 13. In total, the dragon receives 10 damage.\n\nMonocarp knows that the dragon has h hit points, and if he deals at least h damage to the dragon during the battle \u2014 he slays the dragon. Monocarp has not decided on the strength of the poison he will use during the battle, so he wants to find the minimum possible value of k (the number of seconds the poison effect lasts) that is enough to deal at least h damage to the dragon.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of the test case contains two integers n and h (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100; 1 \u2264 h \u2264 10^{18}) \u2014 the number of Monocarp's attacks and the amount of damage that needs to be dealt.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9; a_i < a_{i + 1}), where a_i is the second when the i-th attack is performed.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the minimum value of the parameter k, such that Monocarp will cause at least h damage to the dragon.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n2 5\n1 5\n3 10\n2 4 10\n5 3\n1 2 4 5 7\n4 1000\n3 25 64 1337\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n4\n1\n470\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, for k=3, damage is dealt in seconds [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7].\n\nIn the second example, for k=4, damage is dealt in seconds [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13].\n\nIn the third example, for k=1, damage is dealt in seconds [1, 2, 4, 5, 7]."], "task_id": "1613_C.

Each cell of the grid is either free or blocked. One of the free cells contains a lab. All the cells beyond the borders of the grid are also blocked.\n\nA crazy robot has escaped from this lab. It is currently in some free cell of the grid. You can send one of the following commands to the robot: \"move right\", \"move down\", \"move left\" or \"move up\". Each command means moving to a neighbouring cell in the corresponding direction.\n\nHowever, as the robot is crazy, it will do anything except following the command. Upon receiving a command, it will choose a direction such that it differs from the one in command and the cell in that direction is not blocked. If there is such a direction, then it will move to a neighbouring cell in that direction. Otherwise, it will do nothing.\n\nWe want to get the robot to the lab to get it fixed. For each free cell, determine if the robot can be forced to reach the lab starting in this cell. That is, after each step of the robot a command can be sent to a robot such that no matter what different directions the robot chooses, it will end up in a lab.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6; n \u22c5 m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the number of rows and the number of columns in the grid.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines provides a description of the i-th row of the grid. It consists of m elements of one of three types: \n\n  * '.' \u2014 the cell is free; \n  * '#' \u2014 the cell is blocked; \n  * 'L' \u2014 the cell contains a lab. \n\n\n\nThe grid contains exactly one lab. The sum of n \u22c5 m over all testcases doesn't exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase find the free cells that the robot can be forced to reach the lab from. Given the grid, replace the free cells (marked with a dot) with a plus sign ('+') for the cells that the robot can be forced to reach the lab from. Print the resulting grid.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3 3\n...\n.L.\n...\n4 5\n#....\n..##L\n...#.\n.....\n1 1\nL\n1 9\n....L..#.\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n...\n.L.\n...\n#++++\n..##L\n...#+\n...++\nL\n++++L++#.\n\nNote\n\nIn the first testcase there is no free cell that the robot can be forced to reach the lab from. Consider a corner cell. Given any direction, it will move to a neighbouring border grid that's not a corner. Now consider a non-corner free cell. No matter what direction you send to the robot, it can choose a different direction such that it ends up in a corner.\n\nIn the last testcase, you can keep sending the command that is opposite to the direction to the lab and the robot will have no choice other than move towards the lab."], "task_id": "1613_E.

After this, the elf's favorite number becomes the [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of the values of the lights on the edges in that path.\n\nHowever, the North Pole has been recovering from a nasty bout of flu. Because of this, Santa forgot some of the configurations of lights he had put on the tree, and he has already left the North Pole! Fortunately, the elves came to the rescue, and each one told Santa what pair of nodes he was assigned (a_i, b_i), as well as the parity of the number of set bits in his favorite number. In other words, he remembers whether the number of 1's when his favorite number is written in binary is odd or even.\n\nHelp Santa determine if it's possible that the memories are consistent, and if it is, remember what his tree looked like, and maybe you'll go down in history!\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.

The mischievous duo is now vandalizing a rooted tree, by coloring the nodes while playing their favorite game.\n\nThe game works as follows: there is a tree of size n, rooted at node 1, where each node is initially white. Red and Blue get one turn each. Red goes first. \n\nIn Red's turn, he can do the following operation any number of times: \n\n  * Pick any subtree of the rooted tree, and color every node in the subtree red. \n\nHowever, to make the game fair, Red is only allowed to color k nodes of the tree. In other words, after Red's turn, at most k of the nodes can be colored red.\n\nThen, it's Blue's turn. Blue can do the following operation any number of times: \n\n  * Pick any subtree of the rooted tree, and color every node in the subtree blue. However, he's not allowed to choose a subtree that contains a node already colored red, as that would make the node purple and no one likes purple crayon. \n\nNote: there's no restriction on the number of nodes Blue can color, as long as he doesn't color a node that Red has already colored.\n\nAfter the two turns, the score of the game is determined as follows: let w be the number of white nodes, r be the number of red nodes, and b be the number of blue nodes. The score of the game is w \u22c5 (r - b).\n\nRed wants to maximize this score, and Blue wants to minimize it.

Today, you're working with a long strip, with height 1 and length n, some positions of which are occupied by 1 by 1 Lego pieces.\n\nIn one second, you can either remove two adjacent Lego pieces from the strip (if both are present), or add two Lego pieces to adjacent positions (if both are absent). You can only add or remove Lego's at two adjacent positions at the same time, as otherwise your chubby fingers run into precision issues.\n\nYou want to know exactly how much time you'll spend playing with Legos. You value efficiency, so given some starting state and some ending state, you'll always spend the least number of seconds to transform the starting state into the ending state. If it's impossible to transform the starting state into the ending state, you just skip it (so you spend 0 seconds).\n\nThe issue is that, for some positions, you don't remember whether there were Legos there or not (in either the starting state, the ending state, or both). Over all pairs of (starting state, ending state) that are consistent with your memory, find the total amount of time it will take to transform the starting state to the ending state. Print this value modulo 1 000 000 007 (10^9 + 7). \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then t cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2000) \u2014 the size of the Lego strip.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a string s of length n, consisting of the characters 0, 1, and ? \u2014 your memory of the starting state: \n\n  * 1 represents a position that definitely has a Lego piece, \n  * 0 represents a position that definitely does not have a Lego piece, \n  * and ? represents a position that you don't remember. \n\n\n\nThe third line of each test case contains a string t of length n, consisting of the characters 0, 1, and ? \u2014 your memory of the ending state. It follows a similar format to the starting state.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2000.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the answer to the problem modulo 1 000 000 007 (10^9 + 7). \n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\n2\n00\n11\n3\n???\n???\n3\n??1\n0?0\n4\n??0?\n??11\n5\n?????\n0??1?\n10\n?01??01?1?\n??100?1???\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n16\n1\n14\n101\n1674\n\nNote\n\nFor the first test case, 00 is the only possible starting state, and 11 is the only possible ending state. It takes exactly one operation to change 00 to 11.\n\nFor the second test case, some of the possible starting and ending state pairs are: \n\n  * (000, 011) \u2014 takes 1 operation. \n  * (001, 100) \u2014 takes 2 operations. \n  * (010, 000) \u2014 takes 0 operations, as it's impossible to achieve the ending state.

Each requirement is given by an ordered pair (u, v), meaning that after all operations, the score of reindeer u must be less than or equal to the score of reindeer v.\n\nYour task is to perform the minimum number of operations so that all requirements will be satisfied.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2\u2264 n\u2264 1000; 1\u2264 m\u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of reindeer and requirements, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1,\u2026, a_n (1\u2264 a_i\u2264 10^9), where a_i is the current score of reindeer i.\n\nThe next m lines describe the requirements.\n\nThe i-th of these lines contains two integers u_i and v_i (1\u2264 u_i, v_i\u2264 n; u_i\u2260 v_i) \u2014 the two reindeer of the i-th requirement.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint n integers b_1,\u2026, b_n (-10^{15}\u2264 b_i\u2264 10^{15}), where b_i is the score of the i-th reindeer after all operations.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions achieving the minimum number of operations, you may output any.\n\nWe can prove that there is always an optimal solution such that |b_i|\u2264 10^{15} for all i.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n7 6\n3 1 4 9 2 5 6\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n5 6\n6 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 1 4 4 4 5 6 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n4 6\n6 5 8 2\n3 1\n4 1\n3 2\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n6 6 6 2 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n10 18\n214 204 195 182 180 176 176 172 169 167\n1 2\n3 2\n4 2\n5 2\n6 2\n7 2\n8 2\n9 2\n10 2\n6 1\n6 2\n6 3\n6 4\n6 5\n6 7\n6 8\n6 9\n6 10\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n204 204 195 182 180 167 176 172 169 167 "], "task_id": "1615_H.

The box contains n chocolates. The i-th chocolate has a non-negative integer type a_i.\n\nIcy believes that good things come in pairs. Unfortunately, all types of chocolates are distinct (all a_i are distinct). Icy wants to make at least one pair of chocolates the same type. \n\nAs a result, she asks her grandparents to perform some chocolate exchanges. Before performing any chocolate exchanges, Icy chooses two chocolates with indices x and y (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 n, x \u2260 y).\n\nIn a chocolate exchange, Icy's grandparents choose a non-negative integer k, such that 2^k \u2265 a_x, and change the type of the chocolate x from a_x to 2^k - a_x (that is, perform a_x := 2^k - a_x).\n\nThe chocolate exchanges will be stopped only when a_x = a_y. Note that other pairs of equal chocolate types do not stop the procedure.\n\nIcy's grandparents are smart, so they would choose the sequence of chocolate exchanges that minimizes the number of exchanges needed. Since Icy likes causing trouble, she wants to maximize the minimum number of exchanges needed by choosing x and y appropriately. She wonders what is the optimal pair (x, y) such that the minimum number of exchanges needed is maximized across all possible choices of (x, y).\n\nSince Icy is not good at math, she hopes that you can help her solve the problem.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of chocolates.\n\nThe second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9).\n\nIt is guaranteed that all a_i are distinct.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput three integers x, y, and m.\n\nx and y are indices of the optimal chocolates to perform exchanges on. Your output must satisfy 1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 n, x \u2260 y.\n\nm is the number of exchanges needed to obtain a_x = a_y.

The sequence of exchanges is as follows: 6 \u2192 2 \u2192 0 \u2192 1 \u2192 7 \u2192 9.\n\nIn the second test case, the minimum number of exchanges needed to exchange a chocolate of type 4 to a chocolate of type 8 is 2.

First, Polycarp comes up with a word, consisting only of lowercase letters 'a' and 'b'. Then, he writes down all its bigrams on a whiteboard in the same order as they appear in the word. After that, he wipes one of them off the whiteboard.\n\nFinally, Polycarp invites you to guess what the word that he has come up with was.\n\nYour goal is to find any word such that it's possible to write down all its bigrams and remove one of them, so that the resulting sequence of bigrams is the same as the one Polycarp ended up with.\n\nThe tests are generated in such a way that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 2000) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the length of the word Polycarp has come up with.\n\nThe second line of each testcase contains n-2 bigrams of that word, separated by a single space. Each bigram consists of two letters, each of them is either 'a' or 'b'.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: there exists at least one string such that it is possible to write down all its bigrams, except one, so that the resulting sequence is the same as the sequence in the input. In other words, the answer exists.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase print a word, consisting of n letters, each of them should be either 'a' or 'b'. It should be possible to write down all its bigrams and remove one of them, so that the resulting sequence of bigrams is the same as the one Polycarp ended up with.\n\nThe tests are generated in such a way that the answer exists.

However, that sequence could also have been produced from the word \"abaabaa\". It contains bigrams \"ab\", \"ba\", \"aa\", \"ab\", \"ba\" and \"aa\".

This game has a unique trading mechanics.\n\nTo trade with a character, Monocarp has to choose one of the items he possesses and trade it for some item the other character possesses. Each item has an integer price. If Monocarp's chosen item has price x, then he can trade it for any item (exactly one item) with price not greater than x+k.\n\nMonocarp initially has n items, the price of the i-th item he has is a_i. The character Monocarp is trading with has m items, the price of the i-th item they have is b_i. Monocarp can trade with this character as many times as he wants (possibly even zero times), each time exchanging one of his items with one of the other character's items according to the aforementioned constraints. Note that if Monocarp gets some item during an exchange, he can trade it for another item (since now the item belongs to him), and vice versa: if Monocarp trades one of his items for another item, he can get his item back by trading something for it.\n\nYou have to answer q queries. Each query consists of one integer, which is the value of k, and asks you to calculate the maximum possible total cost of items Monocarp can have after some sequence of trades, assuming that he can trade an item of cost x for an item of cost not greater than x+k during each trade. Note that the queries are independent: the trades do not actually occur, Monocarp only wants to calculate the maximum total cost he can get.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m and q (1 \u2264 n, m, q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5).\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the prices of the items Monocarp has.\n\nThe third line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (1 \u2264 b_i \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the prices of the items the other character has.\n\nThe fourth line contains q integers, where the i-th integer is the value of k for the i-th query (0 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9).\n\nOutput\n\nFor each query, print one integer \u2014 the maximum possible total cost of items Monocarp can have after some sequence of trades, given the value of k from the query.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3 4 5\n10 30 15\n12 31 14 18\n0 1 2 3 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n55\n56\n60\n64\n64"], "task_id": "1618_G.

In other words, for any two players i and j, it must be true |b_i - b_j| \u2264 1. \n\n\n\nFor example, if n=5, m=2 and k=2, then at the request of the first item either two players or three players should play at each table. Consider the following schedules:\n\n  * First game: 1, 2, 3 are played at the first table, and 4, 5 at the second one. The second game: at the first table they play 5, 1, and at the second \u2014 2, 3, 4. This schedule is not \"fair\" since b_2=2 (the second player played twice at a big table) and b_5=0 (the fifth player did not play at a big table).\n  * First game: 1, 2, 3 are played at the first table, and 4, 5 at the second one. The second game: at the first table they play 4, 5, 2, and at the second one \u2014 1, 3. This schedule is \"fair\": b=[1,2,1,1,1] (any two values of b_i differ by no more than 1). \n\n\n\nFind any \"fair\" game schedule for n people if they play on the m tables of k games.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases in the test.\n\nEach test case consists of one line that contains three integers n, m and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u22c510^5, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 \u230an/2\u230b, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of people, tables and games, respectively.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of nk (n multiplied by k) over all test cases does not exceed 2\u22c510^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print a required schedule \u2014 a sequence of k blocks of m lines. Each block corresponds to one game, a line in a block corresponds to one table. In each line print the number of players at the table and the indices of the players (numbers from 1 to n) who should play at this table.\n\nIf there are several required schedules, then output any of them. We can show that a valid solution always exists.\n\nYou can output additional blank lines to separate responses to different sets of inputs.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n5 2 2\n8 3 1\n2 1 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3 1 2 3\n2 4 5\n3 4 5 2\n2 1 3\n\n2 6 2\n3 3 5 1\n3 4 7 8\n\n2 2 1\n2 2 1\n2 2 1"], "task_id": "1619_F.

Recently he found a similar game and there are such rules.\n\nThere are mines on the field, for each the coordinates of its location are known (x_i, y_i). Each mine has a lifetime in seconds, after which it will explode. After the explosion, the mine also detonates all mines vertically and horizontally at a distance of k (two perpendicular lines). As a result, we get an explosion on the field in the form of a \"plus\" symbol ('+'). Thus, one explosion can cause new explosions, and so on.\n\nAlso, Polycarp can detonate anyone mine every second, starting from zero seconds. After that, a chain reaction of explosions also takes place. Mines explode instantly and also instantly detonate other mines according to the rules described above.\n\nPolycarp wants to set a new record and asks you to help him calculate in what minimum number of seconds all mines can be detonated.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases in the test.\n\nAn empty line is written in front of each test suite.\n\nNext comes a line that contains integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of mines and the distance that hit by mines during the explosion, respectively.\n\nThen n lines follow, the i-th of which describes the x and y coordinates of the i-th mine and the time until its explosion (-10^9 \u2264 x, y \u2264 10^9, 0 \u2264 timer \u2264 10^9). It is guaranteed that all mines have different coordinates.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values n over all test cases in the test does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of the lines must contain the answer to the corresponding set of input data \u2014 the minimum number of seconds it takes to explode all the mines.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n\n5 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 4\n1 0 2\n1 1 3\n2 2 9\n\n5 2\n0 0 1\n0 1 4\n1 0 2\n1 1 3\n2 2 9\n\n6 1\n1 -1 3\n0 -1 9\n0 1 7\n-1 0 1\n-1 1 9\n-1 -1 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n1\n0\n\nNote\n\n<image> Picture from examples\n\nFirst example: \n\n  * 0 second: we explode a mine at the cell (2, 2), it does not detonate any other mine since k=0. \n  * 1 second: we explode the mine at the cell (0, 1), and the mine at the cell (0, 0) explodes itself. \n  * 2 second: we explode the mine at the cell (1, 1), and the mine at the cell (1, 0) explodes itself.\n\n\n\nSecond example:\n\n  * 0 second: we explode a mine at the cell (2, 2) we get: \n\n<image>\n\n  * 1 second: the mine at coordinate (0, 0) explodes and since k=2 the explosion detonates mines at the cells (0, 1) and (1, 0), and their explosions detonate the mine at the cell (1, 1) and there are no mines left on the field.

Its developers are currently working on a song recommendation module.\n\nSo imagine Monocarp got recommended n songs, numbered from 1 to n.

In other words, p is a permutation.\n\nAfter listening to each of them, Monocarp pressed either a like or a dislike button. Let his vote sequence be represented with a string s, such that s_i=0 means that he disliked the i-th song, and s_i=1 means that he liked it.\n\nNow the service has to re-evaluate the song ratings in such a way that:\n\n  * the new ratings q_1, q_2, ..., q_n still form a permutation (1 \u2264 q_i \u2264 n; each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once); \n  * every song that Monocarp liked should have a greater rating than every song that Monocarp disliked (formally, for all i, j such that s_i=1 and s_j=0, q_i>q_j should hold). \n\n\n\nAmong all valid permutations q find the one that has the smallest value of \u2211_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i|, where |x| is an absolute value of x.\n\nPrint the permutation q_1, q_2, ..., q_n. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of songs.\n\nThe second line of each testcase contains n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 \u2264 p_i \u2264 n) \u2014 the permutation of the predicted ratings.\n\nThe third line contains a single string s, consisting of n characters. Each character is either a 0 or a 1. 0 means that Monocarp disliked the song, and 1 means that he liked it.\n\nThe sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase, print a permutation q \u2014 the re-evaluated ratings of the songs.

The floor consists of n rows and m columns. The rows of the floor are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and columns of the floor are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. The cell on the intersection of the r-th row and the c-th column is denoted as (r,c). The initial position of the robot is (r_b, c_b).\n\nIn one second, the robot moves by dr rows and dc columns, that is, after one second, the robot moves from the cell (r, c) to (r + dr, c + dc). Initially dr = 1, dc = 1. If there is a vertical wall (the left or the right walls) in the movement direction, dc is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dc is -dc. And if there is a horizontal wall (the upper or lower walls), dr is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dr is -dr.\n\nEach second (including the moment before the robot starts moving), the robot cleans every cell lying in the same row or the same column as its position. There is only one dirty cell at (r_d, c_d). The job of the robot is to clean that dirty cell.\n\n<image> Illustration for the first example. The blue arc is the robot. The red star is the target dirty cell. Each second the robot cleans a row and a column, denoted by yellow stripes.\n\nGiven the floor size n and m, the robot's initial position (r_b, c_b) and the dirty cell's position (r_d, c_d), find the time for the robot to do its job.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nA test case consists of only one line, containing six integers n, m, r_b, c_b, r_d, and c_d (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 r_b, r_d \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c_b, c_d \u2264 m) \u2014 the sizes of the room, the initial position of the robot and the position of the dirt cell.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print an integer \u2014 the time for the robot to clean the dirty cell.

Alice has a set S of disjoint ranges of integers, initially containing only one range [1, n]. In one turn, Alice picks a range [l, r] from the set S and asks Bob to pick a number in the range. Bob chooses a number d (l \u2264 d \u2264 r). Then Alice removes [l, r] from S and puts into the set S the range [l, d - 1] (if l \u2264 d - 1) and the range [d + 1, r] (if d + 1 \u2264 r). The game ends when the set S is empty. We can show that the number of turns in each game is exactly n.\n\nAfter playing the game, Alice remembers all the ranges [l, r] she picked from the set S, but Bob does not remember any of the numbers that he picked. But Bob is smart, and he knows he can find out his numbers d from Alice's ranges, and so he asks you for help with your programming skill.\n\nGiven the list of ranges that Alice has picked ([l, r]), for each range, help Bob find the number d that Bob has picked.\n\nWe can show that there is always a unique way for Bob to choose his number for a list of valid ranges picked by Alice.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000).\n\nEach of the next n lines contains two integers l and r (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n), denoting the range [l, r] that Alice picked at some point.\n\nNote that the ranges are given in no particular order.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000, and the ranges for each test case are from a valid game.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print n lines. Each line should contain three integers l, r, and d, denoting that for Alice's range [l, r] Bob picked the number d.\n\nYou can print the lines in any order. We can show that the answer is unique.\n\nIt is not required to print a new line after each test case.

Initially, the set contains only one range [1, 3]. \n\n  * Alice picked the range [1, 3]. Bob picked the number 1. Then Alice put the range [2, 3] back to the set, which after this turn is the only range in the set. \n  * Alice picked the range [2, 3]. Bob picked the number 3.

The differences are that in this problem, the probability is introduced, and the constraint is different.\n\nA robot cleaner is placed on the floor of a rectangle room, surrounded by walls. The floor consists of n rows and m columns. The rows of the floor are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and columns of the floor are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. The cell on the intersection of the r-th row and the c-th column is denoted as (r,c). The initial position of the robot is (r_b, c_b).\n\nIn one second, the robot moves by dr rows and dc columns, that is, after one second, the robot moves from the cell (r, c) to (r + dr, c + dc). Initially dr = 1, dc = 1. If there is a vertical wall (the left or the right walls) in the movement direction, dc is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dc is -dc. And if there is a horizontal wall (the upper or lower walls), dr is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dr is -dr.\n\nEach second (including the moment before the robot starts moving), the robot cleans every cell lying in the same row or the same column as its position. There is only one dirty cell at (r_d, c_d). The job of the robot is to clean that dirty cell. \n\nAfter a lot of testings in problem A, the robot is now broken. It cleans the floor as described above, but at each second the cleaning operation is performed with probability \\frac p {100} only, and not performed with probability 1 - \\frac p {100}. The cleaning or not cleaning outcomes are independent each second.\n\nGiven the floor size n and m, the robot's initial position (r_b, c_b) and the dirty cell's position (r_d, c_d), find the expected time for the robot to do its job.\n\nIt can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction \\frac x y, where x and y are integers and y not \u2261 0 \\pmod{10^9 + 7} . Output the integer equal to x \u22c5 y^{-1} mod (10^9 + 7). In other words, output such an integer a that 0 \u2264 a < 10^9 + 7 and a \u22c5 y \u2261 x \\pmod {10^9 + 7}.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nA test case consists of only one line, containing n, m, r_b, c_b, r_d, c_d, and p (4 \u2264 n \u22c5 m \u2264 10^5, n, m \u2265 2, 1 \u2264 r_b, r_d \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c_b, c_d \u2264 m, 1 \u2264 p \u2264 99) \u2014 the sizes of the room, the initial position of the robot, the position of the dirt cell and the probability of cleaning in percentage.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the expected time for the robot to clean the dirty cell, modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\n2 2 1 1 2 1 25\n3 3 1 2 2 2 25\n10 10 1 1 10 10 75\n10 10 10 10 1 1 75\n5 5 1 3 2 2 10\n97 98 3 5 41 43 50\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n3\n15\n15\n332103349\n99224487\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the robot has the opportunity to clean the dirty cell every second. Using the [geometric distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution), we can find out that with the success rate of 25\\%, the expected number of tries to clear the dirty cell is \\frac 1 {0.25} = 4. But because the first moment the robot has the opportunity to clean the cell is before the robot starts moving, the answer is 3.\n\n<image> Illustration for the first example. The blue arc is the robot. The red star is the target dirt cell. The purple square is the initial position of the robot. Each second the robot has an opportunity to clean a row and a column, denoted by yellow stripes.\n\nIn the second test case, the board size and the position are different, but the robot still has the opportunity to clean the dirty cell every second, and it has the same probability of cleaning. Therefore the answer is the same as in the first example.\n\n<image> Illustration for the second example.\n\nThe third and the fourth case are almost the same. The only difference is that the position of the dirty cell and the robot are swapped. But the movements in both cases are identical, hence the same result."], "task_id": "1623_D.

For convenience, let's denote l_u and r_u as the left and the right child of the node u respectively, l_u = 0 if u does not have the left child, and r_u = 0 if the node u does not have the right child.\n\nEach node has a string label, initially is a single character c_u. Let's define the string representation of the binary tree as the concatenation of the labels of the nodes in the in-order. Formally, let f(u) be the string representation of the tree rooted at the node u. f(u) is defined as follows: $$$ f(u) = \\begin{cases} <empty string>, & if u = 0; \\\\\\ f(l_u) + c_u + f(r_u) & otherwise, \\end{cases}  where +$$$ denotes the string concatenation operation.\n\nThis way, the string representation of the tree is f(1).\n\nFor each node, we can duplicate its label at most once, that is, assign c_u with c_u + c_u, but only if u is the root of the tree, or if its parent also has its label duplicated.\n\nYou are given the tree and an integer k. What is the lexicographically smallest string representation of the tree, if we can duplicate labels of at most k nodes?\n\nA string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds: \n\n  * a is a prefix of b, but a \u2260 b; \n  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5).\n\nThe second line contains a string c of n lower-case English letters, where c_i is the initial label of the node i for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. Note that the given string c is not the initial string representation of the tree.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains two integers l_i and r_i (0 \u2264 l_i, r_i \u2264 n). If the node i does not have the left child, l_i = 0, and if the node i does not have the right child, r_i = 0.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given input forms a binary tree, rooted at 1.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint a single line, containing the lexicographically smallest string representation of the tree if at most k nodes have their labels duplicated.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n4 3\nabab\n2 3\n0 0\n0 4\n0 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nbaaaab\n\nInput\n\n\n8 2\nkadracyn\n2 5\n3 4\n0 0\n0 0\n6 8\n0 7\n0 0\n0 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\ndaarkkcyan\n\nInput\n\n\n8 3\nkdaracyn\n2 5\n0 3\n0 4\n0 0\n6 8\n0 7\n0 0\n0 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\ndarkcyan\n\nNote\n\nThe images below present the tree for the examples. The number in each node is the node number, while the subscripted letter is its label. To the right is the string representation of the tree, with each letter having the same color as the corresponding node.\n\nHere is the tree for the first example. Here we duplicated the labels of nodes 1 and 3. We should not duplicate the label of node 2 because it would give us the string \"bbaaab\", which is lexicographically greater than \"baaaab\".\n\n<image>\n\nIn the second example, we can duplicate the labels of nodes 1 and 2. Note that only duplicating the label of the root will produce a worse result than the initial string.\n\n<image>\n\nIn the third example, we should not duplicate any character at all. Even though we would want to duplicate the label of the node 3, by duplicating it we must also duplicate the label of the node 2, which produces a worse result.\n\n<image>\n\nThere is no way to produce string \"darkkcyan\" from a tree with the initial string representation \"darkcyan\" :(."], "task_id": "1623_E.
